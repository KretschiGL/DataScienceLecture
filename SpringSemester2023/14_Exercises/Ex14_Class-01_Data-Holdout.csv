 When Pontiac originally introduced the Aztek I think they were going for a younger market  the average buyer has been in the mid 40s  I fit the intial target market  being in my mid 20s  I was really happy to see that Pontiac was fixing every design flaw that I saw in the 2001 models  I didn t like the gray cladding  the orange side marker lamps  and something was wrong in the backend  and the tires were a bit small  In 2002 the gray cladding was made body color  the spoiler was added to the rear  17  tires were made available  and the side marker lamps were clear  Pontiac had fixed it all  I got an advance photo of the 2002 Aztek well before they came out  it looks just like the picture on this page  and immediately declared I was going to buy one just like it  A few months later  I drove back home in my new yellow 2002 AWD Aztek with AWD  I ve had the car for about 6 000 miles and it s been a blast  I ve gone camping several times with it now  including in pouring rainstorm in which the optional tent kept me dry  hauled furniture  hauled bikes  grocercies  went daycamping  light offroading  etc  You name it  I ve done it  I will attest with other reviewers who state that the driving experience is very pleasant  The blind spot takes a bit getting used to  but I love the in dash 6 CD player and 10 speaker stereo system  My other car was a convertible with a decent set of speakers and a 6CD player and the Aztek system sounds just as good  and in many ways better  I love how the interior uses so many different colors and textures  I think this adds to the driving experience  The first thing I really noticed is how it handles with the 17  tires  I would highly recommend these tires to other buyers  as I thought the handling was much better than the 16  models I test drove  If handling is a big deal to you  as it is to me  go with the 17 s  I also happen to think they look much better as well   The 17  option will be available on the 2003s in FWD as well I can t say enough good things about the Aztek  You have to love the console cooler  the sliding cargo tray  the flip and fold seats  the rear headphones  OnStar  all the 12 volt power outlets  and 4 wheel disc brakes  I for one have received very few negative comments about my Aztek   I do think they look best in yellow and 17  wheels though  About half the time at gas stations somebody will just come up to me and start talking about the Aztek  They ask how I like it and how much it cost  and how they think mine looks really good  I tell them what every Aztek owner says  that the it s been a lot of fun owning one and they should go check one out  My favorite feature would probably be the camping package  It consists of a tent that fits over the rear of the vehicle and and an air mattress that fits in the  tek perfectly  I have the towing package with the air compressor  so all you have to do is hit a switch and the Aztek will even fill up the mattress for you  Beyond this  the towing package also increases the towing rating by 1500 pounds  I ve also had a chance to test the AWD system in the snow and man  it works so good it is hard to tell the pavement is slick and the AWD is working  Coming from a FWD car  pulling away from a stop in bad snow your tires will spin for a bit  grab  and then you move forward  With this system  right when you feel like the tires are about to slip  the car starts moving forward  It s a really slick system and very unobtrusive as well  With this years price cuts of basically  2500  the Azteks are also much more affordable to people my age    I would not have been able to afford the AWD at 2001 prices  Many Azteks on lots now have sticker prices of about  22 000  I say go give one a try  Why spend more on another cookie cutter car when you can make a statement and laugh all the way to the bank  
  This review is a summary of our Lemon Law experiences with the  Dodge Caravan  and Chrysler i We purchased a 1998 Dodge Caravan mid 1998  We made the purchase because we had our first child on the way and I wanted something safe and with a lot of room  After a few months we started having trouble with it  Upon acceleration the minivan would  buck  It was difficult to accelerate when getting on parkways  The minivan would jolt  and I considered it to be very dangerous  We brought the minivan back to the dealer 5 times and they never fixed the problem  We had the fuel pumped replaced still had the problem  A computer  co pilot  was installed to record the problem while driving it detected the problem and we thought it would be fixed after that  but it wasn t  The technician even took the minivan home with him and he experienced the problem too  but they were still not able to fix it The 5 times that the van went back to the dealer it was a big inconvenience for us  We literally had to  beg  for a rental  and the car they wanted to give us was a GEO METRO  That was a JOKE and we had to pay for an upgrade to a larger  safer car  Why would I put my son in such a small car  I don t think that Chrysler handled the situation correctly  I spent almost  20 000 for a van that spent a lot of time in the shop  In December 1999 we went through Lemon Law Arbitration  Chrysler tried to settle our case by giving us  1 000 in  damages  and said that they would fix the van my question b If they couldn t fix it before  why could they guarantee that they could fix it now b  Justice was served and we won our case and took our refund and RAN   I would not suggest this vehicle to anyone  even though this may have been an isolated incident  Would  you  want to take that risk  
 I purchased a 1989 Ford Taurus a few years back and was impressed with the ride and comfort coupled with it s gas mileage  I was a little disappointed with the power thus decided to make that a priority with my next automobile  When I decided to sell  I purchased a 1995 Taurus GL to take it s place  The GL is obviously of better quality than the plain one  Both automobiles were are top performers  The power and performances of this type of automobile  along with it s durability and low maintenance is tops  This automobile can certainly take what is dished out  Excellent quality and exquisite ride make this a most desireable car  I prefer the body style and unique design of the  95 model over today s version  I prefer the unique designs that set apart from the obvious  When design unites with quality performance then that is one unique drive  The sport design catches the attention of the youth in all of us  yet the roominess and comfort interests the adult in us  And the quality and durability satisfies all The Ford Taurus has been first on the race track until Nascar made them slow it down where the other cars could keep up  They ve slowed it down six miles an hour  This is one top performing automobile br br  
 I bought my  93 Subaru Loyale in the fall of 2000  I don t believe that it is almost two years ago  my previous car  a small Ford Aspire  was totaled in an accident and I wanted a Japanese car that would fit in the amount of money I got from the insurance company  I found this one as a used buy  obviously  in the local newspaper and I thought why not try a station wagon for a change The person that was selling it kept the car in mint condition  with oil changes every 3 000 miles and all the checkups done by the dealership itself  The car was running great with only 60 000 miles on board even though the looks were a little disappointing at the beginning  I decided to buy it and I have to say I congratulate myself every week for the excellent deal I ve made This car is a  drive as is  car which is the kind everyone is looking for  All I have to do is to put gas from time to time and it would run perfectly  I completely forgot even to change the oil until a week ago  The model I have has power windows  power locks  power steering and power breaks  It has a Honda engine that still looks clean and almost like new and a full size tire reserve located in the front  No air bags  as a matter a fact it s better not having them than having them and not knowing that they will not pop up in a serious frontal accident  as it happened with my Ford  Also the air conditioning is running great and the rails on the top of the car are very useful and they give it a sporty look  The trunk is huge and I used this car many times to carry big loads of stuff when I moved to another city  The model I have only has front wheel drive but for me it is not such a big deal The car is automatic and it runs great both in the city where it runs 28mpg and on the highway where it runs 35mpg  Sometimes it seems that it doesn t have enough power when you start it from rest but this only happens for a couple of seconds  I couldn t say anything about how expensive the replacement parts are for this car because I have never bought any  and to be honest I hope I never find out  This car is so great that I am seriously thinking about buying the new model of Subaru Outback in a few years  About a week ago I put the car to the ultimate test  the new inspection test now required in Houston  TX where I live  you probably heard that they now measure the exhaustions from the car both in 1st and 2nd gear while accelerating  I was preparing myself to pay an exorbitant amount of money to upgrade the exhaustion system  To my surprise not only that the values of dangerous gases exhausted were smaller than the limit allowed but they were zero or very close to zero  I was really impressed What can I say  I love this car and I don t need a shiny new gadgety one  I know that it will last me at least 150 000 miles maybe even 200 000 with the minimum maintenance required and that s all that it matters to me  
 MY EXPERIENCE I test drove a Ford SVT Focus 5 door at a local dealership  My test drive lasted about half an hour  and covered city streets  winding secondary roads  and the freeway  PERFORMANCE If you re going by the numbers  the SVT Focus isn t one of the fastest sport compacts around  most magazines quote a 0 60 time around 7 7 seconds  but I found that its enthusiastic  rev happy engine provided a satisfying sensation of speed in real world driving  Its engine felt just a bit flat at low revs  with fairly weak throttle response below 4000 rpms  But when I let the engine rev up on freeway on ramps  it revealed the other side of its personality eager and exciting  with a linear  forceful pull through the midrange all the way to the redline  This energetic response to hard driving made the SVT feel fun and engaging on the road  despite acceleration times that are just about average for its class  TRANSMISSION CLUTCH I considered the SVT s shifter to be one of the car s weaker points  Not so much because of its shift action which was a bit stiff and padded feeling  but very precise but because of the placement of the shifter itself  Since the SVT Focus is based on the commuter oriented Focus economy car  it inherits the same tall  upright driving position that s found in the lesser models in the Focus family  The base cars have long shift levers to bring the gearknob within easy reach of the driver s hand  but the SVT version has a much shorter shift lever to tighten up the transmission s throws  This allows crisp  short throws from gear to gear  but when combined with the high up driving position  it meant that I had to reach down low somewhat uncomfortably to grab the shift knob  I m sure owners would get used to it  but on my test drive  it felt awkward to reach down for the shifter every time I wanted to change gears  On the bright side  the SVT also has an extremely smooth  precise clutch that engaged quickly for fast gearchanges  but never jerked the car a perfect combination  STEERING HANDLING Along with the eager engine  the SVT s handling was one of its strongest points  The base model Focus is a surprisingly capable handling car  and the SVT takes the chassis  potential to an even higher level  Its steering felt tight and quick  with instant response and firm  hefty weighting that inspired confidence in turns  Plenty of road feel made its way up through the wheel rim  which gave me a good sense of how much grip was left on twisty roads  And grip  incidentally  was in abundance I never felt like I was nearing the car s limits  even during fast cornering  There were several curves where I expected the SVT to understeer  but instead it tracked right through  feeling balanced and neutral which took me by surprise  given the car s front wheel drive layout  There were only two caveats in the SVT s handling behavior  One was a surprising amount of body lean in turns the car always felt rock solid  but I could feel the body leaning more than I expected  The other was freeway cruising  The SVT tracked arrow straight at city speeds  but on the freeway its steering felt just a bit squirmy around the straight ahead  and didn t lock on to a straight path as well as I would have liked  RIDE This area was another strong point for the SVT Focus  Given the car s handling prowess  I was surprised to find that its ride was also quite comfortable for a sport compact  I could tell that the suspension was set up firmly  as its ride motions had a no nonsense directness on rough pavement  but that s the way I prefer cars to ride  It kept me in touch with the road surface  but it took the harshness out of the impacts  and never jolted the cabin abruptly like some firmly suspended cars do  The SVT s structure also felt very tight  which gave the car a rock solid feel over potholed roads  and wind and road noise were surprisingly well muted in normal driving  The only source of annoyance in the SVT s ride was the engine  which was a bit loud and transmitted some buzzy vibrations to the cabin when revved  but this was well within my expectations for a sporty car  INTERIOR This was the only area I considered to be a definitive weak point for the SVT Focus  The interior was solid and well put together  but it basically felt like a dressed up economy car interior because that s what it is and these commuter car roots were sometimes at odds with the SVT s sports coupe mission  A prime example is the driving position  As I mentioned before  the SVT Focus inherits the same tall  upright driving position that you ll find in its lesser brethren  This meant that I sat up high on the seats  with the pedals nudging closer to my feet than I expected  This posture was very different than the racy  reclined driving position of most sport compacts  and it set a family sedan mood that I didn t find conducive to hard driving  On twisty roads  the high chair seating exaggerated the leaning of the body and made me feel like I was sitting on the car  not in it neither of which are reassuring sensations when driving at full tilt  Still  I must admit that this is a matter of taste  I found the seating insufficiently sporty  but others might appreciate the increased visibility and commanding feeling that a high viewpoint allows  But there are other flaws besides the driving position  The quality of the interior materials would be impressive in a  15 000 Focus LX  but they re less pleasing in the  20 000 SVT  which invites comparisons to the classier accommodations of the Celica  Eclipse  and RSX  Also  the dashboard design  with its unusual slashing angles  is a bit distracting I feel that the dash should never distract the driver from the road  especially in a sporty car  These were the extent of my complaints I found the interior roomy and accommodating  with comfortable seats front and rear but the drawbacks were significant  PRACTICALITY Here we return to the good news especially if we re talking about the 5 door hatchback that I test drove  Cars as nimble and entertaining as the SVT Focus have no business being practical  but this car delivers an amazing amount of utility  Besides its comfortable and roomy front seats  the rear seats provided a measure of space and comfort unheard of in the sports coupe class probably because this SVT Focus wasn t a coupe  If the wagon version of the SVT gives up anything to its 3 door hatchback counterpart  I don t know  since I haven t driven one  I still doubt that any buyer would find it lacking in excitement  and the rear doors are sure to come in handy in day to day use  The cargo area was also surprisingly generous with the rear seats folded down  the SVT Focus could have swallowed my bass guitar  my amplifier  and half a drum kit with room to spare  Besides having a unique look  the 5 door version of the SVT Focus delivers fantastic utility and  in my opinion  is a better buy than the 3 door model  RELIABILITY Here s where I m forced to bring back the negativity  Consumer Reports has rated the Focus s reliability Much Worse Than Average  and while they don t specifically rate the SVT model s reliability  one assumes that it falls in line with the rest of the Focus lineup  This is frustrating considering that the rest of the car is so good  and it places me in the awkward position of choosing a rating for an excellent car with poor reliability  OVERALL I ve always considered myself a  Chevy guy  and had a bias against Fords as a result  but the SVT Focus was good enough to convince me that those lingering brand rivalry sentiments are due to be discarded  This is an awesome little car  composed and confident  but eager and high strung at the same time  Its economy car roots certainly result in some awkward compromises the high chair driving position and arm straining shifter placement  in particular but if you can get past those  the total package is satisfying and fun  So what to do with Consumer Reports  low reliability ratings  The threat of breakdowns is an important factor  and in my review of the Focus LX  it was enough to lose my recommendation  In that review  I figured that the first thing on most economy car buyers  minds is value and dependability  and that a poor reliability rating could easily be a deal breaker for those buyers  But the SVT Focus is more of an enthusiasts  car  designed for people who love to drive  and I suspect that if you are smitten with this car and the way it performs  you ll buy it anyway and gladly put up with the potential for mechanical headaches  Since shoppers in the sport compact class are shopping for fun and personality  not practicality  I decided to give the SVT Focus my recommendation  Just keep the poor reliability ratings in mind  and if you re on a tight budget or looking for a daily driver  consider looking at more reliable and equally fun rivals like the Toyota Celica  Acura RSX  Nissan Sentra SE R  and Mitsubishi Eclipse first  
 I fell in love with my Sportage when it was on the showroom floor  It was given a moon roof  10 cd changer and keypad alarm to jazz it up  It was Red with silver on the lower portion  and a spoiler on the back of the roof  and a roof rack This car was so rich looking   I had to have it  so I bought it instantly I know it is a well liked car because the other day  I was waiting for a light to change when my daughter noticed that we were the fourth Kia sportage in a row  we felt like we were in a commercial for Kia I had already bought a  98 sportage the December prior  so I was well aware of the way it handled   especially well in the winter weather The Kia handles very well overall   and the price was right for my pocket book My only complaints about the Kia is the paint scratches too easily  and the brakes have a problem  they wear out too fast Other then that  I think the Kia Sportage is a great little car  and suitable for almost any one   Someone over 6 feet tall might find it not having enough leg room though br br  
 The best part is it was a  brand new  rental car  and we only had to live with it for three days  And  it was Florida  and the A C was killer Now the rest  The body cladding  EWWWW  Maybe it s just my opinion  but how ugly  The design is anything but clean  it s overdone and has too much ribbing  Right up there with the Aztek  The interior  EWWWWWWW  What s with the flamboyantly swoopy dashboard   The Audi TT is an example of how to make a strange but delicious and tasteful interior  If they couldn t afford to put leather in it  don t  The faux leather is brittle and looks like melted plastic  Everything about the car was plastic  plastic  plastic  The buttons felt so cheap  The radio was hard to reach Start it up  Turns on at least  But driving the thing is like driving a boat  It rolls and has the precision of a 100  yacht  Plenty of power  horrible over powered steering  The suspension was soft and springy  For a car that tries  so  hard to be sporty on the outside  it really cannot perform Seats  Uncomfortable  Bonus  lots of rear legroom  If only the rear occupants had a sculpted seatback  or head restraints Traction control  Never had to use it  but if it s as good as the rest of the car  I m scared Safety  Rated  POOR  by the Insurance Institute  The seatbelt failed to work right  allowing the dummy to smash his head on the door sill and B pillar  His leg and foot was crushed when the safety cage collapsed  The dashboard got shoved back into him as an added tasty bonus  Plus  no side or head protection airbags available  Recorded injury death claims for the vehicle are very high  Bumpers are poor  ditto for the head restraints I d take a Dodge Neon over a Grand Am  But if it was my money  I d spend it on a Jetta  Golf  or Civic  Those have much tighter handling  nicely made interiors  and aren t complete death traps like the Grand Am Good riddance  
 My mom had a 1986 Ford Taurus  I belive it was the first year of of cars  We were lucky to get the worst car ever  a 4 cyl  taurus  So depressing  My mom bought this car in 1994 after her last car was stolen  Ohhh i remember going with her to pick it up  It looked nice in the garage it was in  really it did  My mom started it and we were on our way  It felt like we were riding in an enclosed lawnmower  That is what it felt and sounded like  The way it sounded was the very least that was wrong with the car  In time the drivers side window became a problem  It was fine to open  but when it came time to close  the window went out instead of up  real nice for protection huh  The car wasnt very mechanically well built either  I was lucky enough to be driving the car when its transmission droppd dead  Thats right folks  pouring rain  up a hill  in the worst area of NYC and lots of traffic  I wasnt too happy  and niether was the 20 cars behind me  Someone did help me push the car though  So after the transmission was fixed it worked  sort of  A few monthes later the car went on fire  now that i think about it   it was taken to the mechanic at least once a week because the engine was smoking  severly overheating  Did i metion we kept water in the car incase the car went on fire  Oh yea  another thing  the hood couldnt stay up by itself  he held it open with a hockey stick  oh yea and another thing about opening the hood  well the thing u pulled back on to make the hood release broke off  so we had to pull the wires with a vice grip  The windsheild washer pump never worked  and winshield wipers didnt work either  OK OK  and the rear bumber was falling off since the day we got the car  Needless to say the tranmission died again  and my mom gave to car away  All these things happned within 7500miles of eachother when we got the car it had 49 000 miles  piece of junk no br br  
 Kinda Like the Girl in Pretty Woman  Good Looking  but pretty darn unrefined Face it  the old Ford Taurus was butt ugly  The front lights looked utterly bug like  and the dashboard was so  revolutionary  it was confusing  The new Taurus remedies some of the problems of the old one  as the dashboard is pretty straghtforward  and the body  while not a knockout  is far better looking than the old one  While the car feels solid  at least the doors  The body panelling just has a thin look to it  maybe from cheaper than average paint  And while the dash is far less cluttered than before  one has to think about the designers who thought that rubber plastic looks good  and the little TV style volume markers on the LCD display  I mean  if it sounds loud enough for you  who cares about the little markers When I first got behind the wheel of the Taurus  the steering wheel struck me as a little odd  its smaller than the average steering wheel  by maybe about two inches in diameter  My hands felt closer together than normal on this steering wheel  and while it did nothing to detract from driving it  it was disconcerting at first  The wheel might have been designed for those with smaller hands in mind  but it works for the bigger handed among us too The car does not seem underpowered  but one would not get that impression by listening to the transmission  which is loud  rough  and shifts very loudly  especially when starting up from a red light  When you floor the gas pedal  the transmission will suddenly shift down to first or second  and it makes the entire front of the car very  very  loud as it reaches and passes the 3000 RPM mark  Fortunately  this only lasts a few seconds  however  regular shifting is also quite loud  At least it doesn t shift very much on highway driving  and it rarely  hunts  on winding  hilly  country roads The front seats are comfy  and the footrest is placed just about right for my length of feet and legs  The rear seats are more cramped than other cars in it s class  and they could be less angled  at least in my opinion  The trunk is not small  however it is a tad shallow The pillars behind the rear seat are kinda wide  so backing up is a slight chore if you have to look to the side  for kids  for example  Also  the brake light hump is incredibly large  and it not only takes up a lot of space in the rear view mirror  but it also covers up a lot of the trunk area  so that it is hard to see the edge f the trunk when you look through the rearview mirror  so it is difficult to judge the length of the rear of the car Another unrefined part of this car would be the brakes  These brakes don t kick in until the pedal is most of the way down  and the brakes gradually get stronger so that they are grabby only at the end of the pedal stroke  and even to just slow the car down  the pedal should be pushed nearly all the way to the bottom of the stroke B The Verdict B This car  while not bad  isn t up to the competition  The Camry is a much smoother driver  as is the Accord  However  if you are a die hard American car owner  than this is probably the car for you  whil it might not match the import competition  this car is in many ways still far better than it s Chevy and Buick competition  
 Back in 1995 I heard that Dodge will be remodeling the Caravan  which I was interested to buy  In 1997 I bought the Caravan for  20650  I thought that Chysler would have fixed all the bugs it had to the new model  but I was wrong  On the first week of driving the van the engine failed and took 2 months to fix the problem  Next came the crazy windsheild wipers  The windsheild for some reason turn on itself without me ever turning it on  The dealer replace the timing with a fixed timing  Then the radio broke and had to replace  After that the air condition got infected with bacteria  which made the air smell really bad  The next thing that had a problem was the steering wheel it was clicking when I turn and was fixed The only thing that I ever like this van is the price and comfort of it  It offer quite a lot  But the rolling seats are a headache  it s too heavy and needs two person to be able to get it out Driving it is very easy with it s foward cab design The van is okay but if you are willing to risk the problems go ahead and buy one for yourself  but I won t ever again     
 My lifelong dream was to own a Beetle  I liked the older designs  but when I saw commercials for the new models  I flipped  I begged my parents to get one for the family  but they said we had to sell one of our other cars  After that was accomplished  my folks headed up to Menomonee Falls and their EVS dealership and came back home with a brand spankin  new 2001 dark blue Volkswagen Beetle for ourselves  And I loved it right from the start When we went to the same dealership to look at the selection a few weeks before  we looked at many a Beetle  and quite frankly  it looked cramped as h ll  The backseat area seemed almost nonexistent  and the front seats didn t look too comfortable  But when I got behind the wheel  my fears were instantly unfounded  There WAS room  and lots of it  The dashboard is HUGE you d probably be able to sleep on the thing if necessary  I also found out that you can adjust the steering wheel to wherever you feel comfortable driving with it  A plus right there  The car also has keyless entry  one of those little handheld things that locks and unlocks doors  has a panic button and opens the trunk  for those of you who don t know  and whenever you drive for a few seconds  the doors lock by themselves for added safety  Another plus While driving it  I found that it handled like a charm  Steering it was very easy  and you barely even need to turn the wheel when you turn left or right  whereas our other vehicle  a 2000 Dodge Dakota quad cab  had a very tight steering wheel  and you needed to turn it for what seemed like forever  Not with das Beetle  Yet another plus The only bad thing about this car  however  is that the 0 20 acceleration time is very slow  It takes roughly four to five seconds for it to go from 0 to 20  That s kind of ridiculous  because if I take this for my driver s test  the instructor might get on my back about me not accelerating enough  I d say   quot It s the car  d mmit quot Other than that  this is a terrific car to own  There s never been a day that I haven t seen a Beetle on the road or in a driveway somewhere  Now there s one in ours  and I couldn t be happier  Buy one today you won t regret it  Trust me br br  
 I bought my first Honda in 1994  I was young and stupid  and didn t do any research into buying a new car  but God was leading me by the hand  I ended up with a brand new 1994 Civic DX  At this time the car came standard with A C and a cassette deck  The A C went out pretty quickly  and I had to have it fixed a couple of times before it worked to it s full potential  I wasn t too crazy about the unibody  one dent and virtually the entire body would have to be replaced I now own a 1997 Civic EX  and couldn t be more thrilled  I bought it brand new  and it has run like a dream  I am horrible about getting my oil changes  and went a year without one  I know  I m stupid  My point is  I didn t notice any difference in the performance until after a year of driving with the same oil  The only problems I have had are the windshield washer pump  the driver s side electric window motor  and the driver s side floor mat  A recall was put out on the floor mat  and they attached an eyelet to hook the mat over  I haven t had a problem with the mat since then  When I took the car in for the window motor  they had about twelve other cars with the same problem  And the windshield washer pump won t spray the fluid onto the windshield  it just kind of dribbles  unless I m doing about eighty mph  When I took it into the shop for that  it worked fine  imagine that Other than those three things  I love my car  Mine is a five speed  four cyl  but it gets around like a V 6  It is sporty and sleek  with room to seat four comfortably  five is pushing it  The trunk is enormous  I also have the Honda Care auto plan  and it has been a big help  For ten dollars a month  it covers all your scheduled oil changes  flat tires  tow charges  etc  It is a great plan  There are so many disposable cars on the road these days  i e  Neon s  and the Honda Civic really stands out in the crowd  It is great on gas I spend about ten dollars every two weeks when I am just driving around town A Honda is a well built auto  this is evident when you still see 1970 s models on the roads  This is a great first car  a great second for a family  and great for single people like myself br br  
 My original review of the Quest was posted for the 2000 model  not the 2001   oops   this will be the correction My mom bought a Nissan Quest this year  Why a Quest  She needs something fairly large  and station wagons aren t built much these days  so she was pretty much stuck with buying a minivan She has an old station wagon that has too many miles on it and lots of undependability  but she hasn t used the Quest much  the vehicle probably has under 500 miles on it so far  Some people worry about the size of the Quest even though it doesn t  drive  as large as it looks I believe this is the GXE model  base MSRP   manufacturer s suggested retail price   about  22 400 The vehicle looks larger than a mid size vehicle  but that s because it s a bit higher than a sedan  I ve driven it a few times  and it s not as hard to move around as it looks  The Quest is between 16 and 16 1 2 feet long  between 6 and 6 1 2 feet width  between 5 1 2 and 6 feet high  and between 9 and 9 1 2 feet for wheelbase length The seats seem plush  but increase static   minor annoyance  B Some bits of standard equipment  The Quest has a six cylinder engine with fuel injection  an automatic transmission and cruise control Estimated gas mileage is 17 city  24 highway Brakes are anti lock type Fuel tank has a 20 gallon capacity There are two sliding passenger doors and a tailgate There s an AM FM radio   no tape or CD player with ours   There is also a keyless entry system   click a button on the remote  unlock the doors  The vehicle has powered windows Steering wheel is tiltable The vehicle has halogen headlights Seven passenger seating The model my mom has isn t filled with that many extras  no extra interior lighting  no video screen for VHS playing And now  info from the manual B Seats  restraints and supplemental air bag systems  The Quest holds seven people  Two bucket seats in the front  a bench seat   holds two   OR two separate bucket seats in the second row  a bench seat   holds three   in the third row The front seats are separate from each other  they can be slid forward or backward  and reclined  Each seat has a headrest that can be moved up down  These seats have the option of being powered   not taken on the mom s   There are also optional storage trays located under the seats If the second row has a bench seat  the seat has armrests  the armrests can be flipped up  The seats also have headrests  but they can t be adjusted  It can also be removed Bucket seats in the second row can be removed If the second row seat s  is are removed then the third row seat can moved to that spot The rear bench seat can also be slid   forward backward   and reclined The second row bench seat and third row seat can be folded   creating a decent amount of flat space

 We bought our 1995 Astro van with 18 000 miles on it It was 2 years old  Since that time we have replaced the engine  3 200  Front rocker arm assembly   700  Brakes 400  Shocks  250 rear seal 175 new battery 75  Now the anti lock brake light is on and the front end shakes when braking what next  My 1975 Chevy Vega was more reliable  I replace my oil every 3 000miles  For the weight and size I think a full sized van would be a better bargin  I can t wait to get rid of this piece of junk  I never spent this much on repairs as this vehicle  1995 Chev  Astro for sale  good reliable transportation  PS AC AWD 50 000miles  Well maintained  b o 6 5 00 Since this epinion was written  I have continued to repair and maintain this vehicle  In the last 3 weeks I have replaced the muffler  alternator  windshield wiper motor  exhaust manifold gasket   1 400 total  I came very close to getting rid of it  but I have so much money invested in it BTW the air conditioning needs to be repaired now     
 In the summer of 2000  I purchased a 2000 Ford F 250 Super cab with the 4DR 4WD Off Road package  It has the 7 4L Turbo diesel engine  and leather seats  with all the accessories  Personally  i love it  for its driver passenger space  its pulling trailer pulling power  and the overall luxury and comfort of the interior  Considering the fact that its a pick up truck  i believe it has some of the best comfort that i ve ever experienced in a truck  The size of the truck is a little annoying  especially when pulling U turns and parking  but hey  it is a full sized truck and i knew that so i doesnt matter  The gas mileage of the truck is fair for its engine size  15 city  19 highway  or at least thats what i get  The acceleration of the truck is impressive  and its a rush to hear the turbo kick in when you slam on the gas  The handling isnt the greatest but i wasnt expecting that in a huge truck anyway  I would recommend this truck for a working man or woman if you like bigger sized trucks  or have horses or other  quot toys quot  to haul around  The safety of this truck is great considering when driving through the city and i get stopped at a red light next to an 18 wheeler  i can almost look straight over at them  There are tons of modifications you can add on for more speed or power  but i feel that its already got enough of both  I truly enjoy this truck and strongly recommend it to people who want to spend a little money for a truck that will last a life time br br

 I purchased my 2000 Nubira Wagon  CDX  in February  Since then I have put over 6000 enjoyable  trouble free miles on it with no problems whatsoever  The car handles well and is fun to drive  While it is not the quickest car I ve ever driven on takeoff  it will cruise at interstate speeds and above quite comfortably  In my opinion it is very comfortable for a car in it s size class  It has a lot of cargo space with the back seats folded down The Nubira has an overall feel of quality and craftsmanship  and the CDX model is fully loaded with options like leather interior  sun roof  and AM FM Cassete  amp  CD Player My wife loves to use it to buy groceries because of the ease of loading them into the rear hatch instead of having to sit them over into the trunk of a regular car Overall I don t think you will be disappointed if you buy a Daewoo I certainly have not been br br  
 I wanted something that could haul anything  anywhere  and at anytime  At the same time  I wanted it to have a comfortable ride  and good handling  My Ford Explorer Limited has done all of this and more  I ve only had to do regular maintenance services  If I were to knock it  I wish it stood taller on the road  Mine is a 1995 and has performed better than I expected  I do wish utility vehicles got a little better gas mileage  The seats are comfortable on long trips  I m not beat up nor fatigued when I get to my destination  It s a nice compromise between a regular road car  van  amp  pick up truck  I d highly recommend one to any one looking for versatility  If you want a vehicle that will do many things besides get you there  you should definitely consider a utility vehicle  You won t be disappointed     
 Having recently moved to VA and in need of a car that was affordable and good I went to ford  When they said all I could qualify for was an escort I went no  but then they showed me the 2 door sport coupe and I fell in love  For a two door there is a lot of room inside the car  it only sits four but you all have enough room  It s a 5 speed and handles wonderful in the snow having been in the desert for 9 years I needed something that would make it through  It does not look like the typical escort box that we are all used to it s sleek and nice to look at  hugs the roads and has a smooth ride I don t recommend someone who is 6 2 buying this car but at 5 5 quot  it s comfortable  low cost and a great way to rebuild your credit if that is what you need at Less than 12K you can t get a better deal br br  
 One of Newton s laws of motion states  paraphrased  that a body in motion tends to remain in motion  The principle under discussion is commonly known as inertia  Inertia  we all know  is not merely a physical phenomenon  it s also a phenomenon that exerts influence over such varied arenas as the stock market and personal relationships   how many couples do you know  for instance  that stay together far too long because the act of breaking up takes too much energy  Inertia occurs in the marketplace  of that we can be certain  One of the most telling forms of inertia is a consumer s attachment to a brand or to a model  Such devotion asserts itself in an  It done me right the last time  so I ll stick by it the next time  attitude  a sort of Tammy Wynette  model for consumption  We often sense inertia here at Epinions  especially in the Automotive category  where hardly a day goes by that I don t read a review stating that  I have always bought   insert car maker i  cars  In fact  automobiles may be the only consumer product in which inertia is an inherited force  hardly a day goes by in which I don t read a review that says   my  family  has always bought  insert car maker  cars Perhaps I grew up in an unusual family  my parents drove Pontiacs  Fords  Chevvies  Dodges  Chryslers  Oldsmobiles  Studebakers  Ramblers  you name it  they drove it some time in the fifties  sixties  or seventies  And so I never developed that somewhat slavish brand loyalty   and  I venture  the condition best described by the observation that  love is blind  But I know that there are a lot of blind consumers out there b America s Most Popular Car b Advertisements tell us that the Ford Taurus is America s most popular car  Note  however  that you can always tell when an advertising man is lying because his lips are moving  What  is  true is that the Taurus is  one  of the most popular cars ever sold in this country  and  if you lump Mercury Sable in with the Taurus  there are as many of them on the road as there are of any other vehicle  More importantly  the Taurus   an ugly  melted looking critter at its birth   marked Ford s re emergence as a power in the mid sized car market after more than a decade of shoddy quality  ill advised experimentation  and simple ignorance of consumer trends  Finally  America was making a car that was competitive against Japanese imports  so much so that it actually began making inroads into that import market  Hooray for American ingenuity and engineering As such  the Taurus developed a near cult following  giving a new generation a vehicle on which to lavish the family s Ford addiction  Suddenly if you ached to drive a stylish  dependable car  you didn t have to hide the Toyota from Dad or watch Uncle Stan sneer at the Honda  And so the Taurus  and its  name plate twin  the Mercury Sable  became Ford s  comeback kid  Three cheers for Henry  Edsel  and the rest of the Fords b Fast Forward to 2002  Over the years  I ve driven lots of Tauruses  Tauri  always as a rental  I ve driven them through snow  in the baking desert sun  at the beach  and on winding mountain roads  While I ve never been tempted to buy a Taurus  frankly  it s larger than I need  I ve never been unimpressed by the car  either  This is a vehicle that s always seemed to be a solid  dependable   if somewhat boring   performer  but then I d never reviewed one for Epinions  either  So here s my chance  after having looked at a 2002 Taurus with a critical eye b The Car  My ever faithful suppliers at Enterprise rented me a 2002 Taurus SE model  a four door  with the stock V6 Vulcan engine and a four speed automatic transmission  This particular model has a  convertible  front seat  which is a bench seat with a center panel that unfolds into a console and or armrest to create the illusion of bucket seats  The vehicle came equipped with dual airbags  power doors windows mirrors  cloth seats  AM FM Cassette  tilt wheel  cruise control  intermittent wipers  styled aluminum wheels  and AC  I picked it up with about 5500 miles on the clock  I turned it back in with just over 6000   five days and 500  miles  About 400 miles were highway driving  the rest on city streets and freeways in the Austin and Houston areas  Weather was mostly dry  though my return to Austin encountered some moderate showers b Styling Notes  For those interested in such things  the vehicle was a metallic charcoal gray with a multi shade gray interior  That particular combination is apparently quite popular  one night in my hotel parking garage I had to choose among the Taurus  a Mustang  and a Contour all in that color combination  I stayed with the Taurus  cause I didn t have keys for the Mustang This model was restyled by Ford with the 2000 model year  Speaking from memory  earlier models were far more dependent upon the oval motif  and still retained some of the original version s melted external contours  The restyling possesses slightly more angularity than the old version  with sharper slope breaks at the base of the rear window and on the trunk line  The interior has much of the  chunky  look adopted by many automakers in the latest  90s and early 2000s  Blocks of foam filled  naugahyde  tend to fight for supremacy with contoured plastic panels in the dash and on the doors  The seating arrangements do not appear to have changed from earlier models  and the instrument panel and dashboard layouts are little changed  if at all b Driver Car Interface  The Taurus handles moderately well for a mid sized family sedan  cornering is responsive with neither crispness nor poor control  The driver has a good connection to the road when compared to larger vehicles such as the Lincoln Continental  but is more isolated than when driving most Japanese sedans  Mitsubishi Galant  Toyota Camry  Braking tends to feel a bit mushy at highway speeds  The stock 155 hp Vulcan V6 possesses adequate reserve power at highway speeds  but is noticeably weak on acceleration from a standing start  this is the least powerful of three available V6 engines  I averaged about 21 5 MPG with this engine  note  mostly highway driving  The four speed overdrive transmission shifts smoothly and responsively for the most part  In this model  the shifter is mounted to the steering column The cockpit is laid out comfortably  with most controls easily accessible and few  if any  surprises  The intermittent wipers and headlight dimmer switch are located on the turn signal stalk  The cruise control buttons are on the face of the steering wheel  on off on the left and accelerate coast resume on the right b Driving Environment  The driver s seat in this configuration has a seat back tilt adjustment and forward backward adjustment  both manual  There is no lumbar adjustment  Driver seating is relatively comfortable  though the lack of lumbar support is somewhat bothersome  Rear seat entry in the four door models is a piece of cake  and rear seat room is average or above for vehicles of this class  There are sturdy anchor points for two child car seats on the car s rear deck There is a single small  rather strangely shaped glove compartment and the ubiquitous door side map pockets  Ford provides a single cubby in the dashboard for front seat passengers  Rear seat passengers have pockets on the seatbacks suitable for stowing a magazine and little else  There are two power ports  both in front  one doubles as a cigarette lighter  The rearseat passengers have two flip out cupholders  front seat passengers have two cupholders molded into the underside of the fold up seatbottom  This latter surface also has minimal storage for cassettes and a few coins  it dumps its contents when inverted  no surprise there  to form a seat cushion  The only locking space in the cabin is the glove compartment  Note  that when the seat is in  bench  configuration  there are no cup holders and little storage  probably moot  anyway  since the room would be rather limited The trunk is a capacious 17 cubic feet  although the sill is quite high  making loading cumbersome for shorter drivers and passengers  The circumference is notched for a cargo net  though there was none in the rental vehicle  it may be standard and have  disappeared  The lid opens with a key or a dash mounted remote  and there is also an emergency latch for opening from the inside  The rear seats do not fold down  nor is there any sort of  pass through  for carrying long cargo  a disappointing lack of a feature available in other trim lines and on competing models Engine noise is somewhat intrusive  partially because this particular engine seems to be rather  grumbly  Road noise is minimal unless the road surface is coarse  but wind noise is also rather pronounced b Highs and Lows  These are my personal observations about this Taurus model  with additional explanation where necessary i Positives  the Accelerator Pedal   good rear seat room  large trunk capacity  good climate control  clear dash and instrument panel layout  fuel economy i Mmmmm  Maybe  The Neutral Zone   engine acceleration  road handling and braking  an average climate control system  road noise and wind noise i Negatives  the Brake Pedal   no fold down rear seat  amateurish looking design to interior components  especially the  console  engine noise  a disturbing metallic rumble at idle  cheesy stock sound system  poor quality control  see below  that stupid front seat console and lack of interior storage b On Quality  One of the reasons many US buyers deserted American carmakers in the seventies and early eighties was the perception of poor quality in US cars  If all American cars are as poorly made as this particular Taurus  the exodus should begin anew  In only four day s exposure  I noted the following defects  The ignition key was hard to turn and more than once failed to release from the  START  position   this left the starter motor engaged until I manually released the key  At least one body seam had variable width along its length  a definite no no  one panel is therefore misaligned  There was a quarter of an inch of mismatch between interior panels on the back of the front seat  Flashing  excess plastic from the molding process  had not been trimmed off the interior of the trunk  especially in the clips for the cargo net  The fuel gage would not rise above 7 8 even when filled b Overall  Ford appears to have decided to rest on its laurels with this vehicle  and has not done what is necessary to keep it competitive with the Camry  Accord  Galant  Impala  and the like  I suspect they re counting on brand loyalty    inertia    to keep the Taurus selling while they expend all their energy on their SUVs  Not a good idea  Ford  Not recommended  for unimaginative exterior styling  some truly stupid interior styling  poor quality  and average drivability  There are better cars on the road  let s buy  them  instead i Tammy Wynette  country Western artist  perhaps most widely known for her counter feminist anthem  Stand By Your Man i  
 This truck has been no problem at all  I don t wanna say something that will make it start to break  but hey  it s not been a problem at all I ve done the serpentine belt  breaks  thermostat  air filter  spark plugs  tires  and battery  After all that  and 136K miles  and 5 years  I d say it s one heck of a car I have not religiously gotten my oil changed  I did it about every 15K to 20K miles  I recently started getting it changed at a regular schedule  and got my radiator flushed  Someone told me that the 4 0L truck engine from Ford has a tendency to be a problem if you don t get the radiator flushed regularly There is a problem with this model as it relates to the 4WD  After 1996 Ford built Explorers with a modified truck frame  The 1996 and previous do not have this  This makes it necessary to rotate your tires a lot  about every 3 5K miles  You might do this  but if you don t  you get some serious chatter on the tires  and some really bad road noise Outside of all that  the truck is great  Performance ain t what it used to be  what do you expect after 5 years  In any case  the performance isn t that bad  I can still merge onto the highway just fine   Keep an eye on the recalls  I replaced my anti sway hookups before the big  Firestone Fiasco  and never owned any Firestone tires  
 You rarely hear of a truck being considered a family vehicle but I use mine in that capacity  I bought a 1997 Ford F 150 extended cab Lariat edition  It has plenty of room in the back for small children  I have a son who is six and a daughter who is two months  There is room for both of them and bags of groceries  It can also sit small adults well but the leg room in the back is very limited  The back seats also are not padded well and would not be recommended for adults on long trips  The Lariat comes with cruise  power door  windows  seat  drivers  and mirrors  The floor is carpeted  but we put in plastic floor mats when we go to my parents farm  It is great for limited hauling and off road riding  On road it has a smooth ride but more noise than you may be used to in a car priced in the same range      
 Ever had the need for space  Ever dream of driving in style in a full size vehicle  Now you can  all the space and style you need in a pick up truck  The F150 is a excellent truck for towing  moving  working  camping  and you can even fit the whole family in it  The suspension is the best on any vehicle and the control is very smooth  although the turning ratio can be better  If you like changing the look of your vehicle this is the truck to get  From custom wheels to body kits  For those who love speed you can even upgrade the engine to match the F150 lighting  When ford changed the look of the F150 I knew it would be mine  don t let the others change your mind  this is the truck if you like style  When it comes to power theres nothing like a V8 engine to do any job  Excellent truck and brilliant design br br  
 I may a little biased in my opinions of these cars  but I think it is well founded  I purchased my car used and have since put over 60 000 miles on it  I have only had one major problem with the car  It was a bad head gasket  It cost me a about  700 to have it fixed  I was told by the mechanic that this was common in these cars and that BMW actually made an update to solve this problem If you are looking to get attention when you drive your car  this has to be one of the most affordable ways to do it  I have added many aftermarket goodies to my car and it makes it that much more eye appealing  Many items are available to suit any budget People respect you more when you pull up in a fine automobile  A car says alot about you as a person and makes a statement about your success in life  I have found that just by driving it people take you more serious  Funny I could have this much fun for only about 20 grand If you want cheap thrills and a great performing car  This is the ticket br br  
 My experience with a Ford Escort  is that it is a very excellent vehicle  I do admit that it does have it s draw backs  The Ford Escort that I owned had absolutely no pickup  If you would like a car with some balls  you would not choose the Escort  If you would like a car that will be reliable and run well  then you would want to purchase an Escort  I had my Escort for about 6 months and I had absolutely no problems with it  I sold it for a car with more pickup  but I sold it to a person I am in contact with it and he has had no problems either  Ford Escort s are also very good on gas mileage  If you don t have a lot of money to purchase a car  then you won t have that much money for gas  So  it would be wise to buy a car with good gas mileage  I would recommend an Escort if you want to get around town  cheap  It took me  usually  8 dollars to fill my tank and that would last me a week  My recommendation to you would be to purchase a Ford Escort to save you time and money in repairs you would have to do on a different car     
 I bought this vehicle as a trade from a minivan  needing the seating capacity for a family  I was amazed at how well the Expedition drove and how comfortable everyone was in it  I love the fact that it drives and handles like a car but can go wherever it wants  This vehicle is for the buyer that wants the luxury of a big SUV without taking out a second mortgage to get it  This vehicle is easy to handle and with the 5 4L engine can get up and go  The only caution is that it sits very high and ladies will need a running board to get up in the vehicle when they wear a dress or skirt  The rear air and backseat radio control make all the difference in comfort during a long trip  I recommend it to anyone who likes the room and comfort of a big vehicle without feeling like you are driving a bus br br  
 I purchased my Suby 2 5RS just over a year ago  The sticker price was  20 900  I paid  18 800 with an alarm system installed  It came standard with all wheel drive  AC  PW  PL  Sunroof  4 wheel disk brakes with 4 wheel anti lock  cruise  CD cassette stereo system  fog lights  tilt steering  dual airbags and 3 point seat belts in the rear seat  I live in New England so I wanted something with all wheel drive but also a little sporty  I have three children ages 12 to 7 so I also needed something practical  The 4 door 2 5RS is perfect  I drive for a living and I already have about 50 000 miles on the car in a year  I change the oil and filters myself and even did a few performance modifications  There has not been a single problem with the car  not one  I ve been getting about 30mpg on the highway and 23mpg around town so the mileage is a little higher than what they told me  We can fit the three kids in the back and a weeks worth of groceries in the trunk and still have some room left over  I m a large man 6 0  235lbs  and I feel comfortable in the car for 6 7 hour drives and have plenty of leg and head room even with the sunroof  One drawback is the anti lock brakes are little touchy and seem to kick in too often on wet and sandy surfaces  I was told this was addressed in the 2002 model  The paint seems to be very thin and chips easy  I would recommend and front end bra if you are doing a lot of highway driving  Other than that the car has been perfect  If shopping for a new car I would suggest looking in the spring and summer in the north  the dealers didn t seem to want to deal as much on these in the winter time because of the high demand for all wheel drive cars  I waited till April to purchase and saved an extra  1500 over the best deal they offered in November  
 When I was 18  I took my first road trip from Salt Lake City to Denver  away from my parents  with one of my friends  We decided to rent a car  rather then drive our little 4 cylinder econo sedans  both were questionable to make it to denver and back  The year was 1994  and the car  a brand new 1994 Ford Mustang V6 LX  red  with 100 miles on it  I had never before paid any attention to the Mustang  but after this road trip  the Mustang would become my want  my desire  and my passion  I never thought I would fight so much with a friend over something like who would drive a rental car  but this car definately was worth fighting over  You see  back in 1993 they re designed the body style on the Mustang  And  so  when we rented this car  they were not a dime a dozen like they are now  and the car turned many heads  In fact  even the valet guys at the hotel seemed to fight over who would park our rental car  All this over a V6 Mustang no less  not even a GT  Did I mention my friend got a speeding ticket in Wyoming  Did I mention that I opened her up and had her up to 135 on the I 80     It wouldn t be until October of 2001 before I had the financial means to purchase a Mustang  but when I did   I went all out  I purchased a brand new 2001 Ford Mustang GT Convertable  Red  with all the  Premium  options  including leather seats  Mach 460 sound  17  alloy wheels  and a 5 speed transmission  Out the door  the car was  28 800   plus tax  I ended up financing the bad boy for  653 a month  Now you may think that s a lot of money to pay  but when you think about financing a  30 000 car for 5 years  you re going to find it costs a LOT of money  versus leasing the same car  So  if you can t afford 650 a month for a GT Convertable  I recommend one of two things  a  buy a used one with under 30 000 miles on it   you ll save about  8 10 000 dollars doing so  my car depreciated  8 000 in the first year    or b  lease it   you can lease these for around  400 a month if you can find special incentives or deals at your local Ford Dealer  On to the car  This car is a dream to drive  Every day I hop into the car  pull out of my garage  and drop the top down  and cruise to work  It s ALWAYS a pleasure to drive this car  It puts a smile on my face  and I feel very happy about making that car payment every month  The car always gets a lot of looks  I mean what s there not to love about the looks on a GT convertable  When the light turns red  and I floor it  the car takes off like a rocket  and I love being pushed back into my seat  And yes  if you are angry at someone and you want to make a statement  I highly recommend turning the traction control off  and burning a little bit of rubber  It does very well at that How about cornering   Well  you know those ramps on the freeway that have 25mph speed limit signs on them  There s a reason for that  The DOT determines the average  safe  speed that you will be able to maintain control of your vehicle around the corner of that on off ramp  and they put a sign up  Well  let s just say I frequently find myself going 50 60mph around those 25mph turns  and guess what  The mustang sticks to the road like glue  and it feels safe  and secure  You get a huge rush of blood to your head from the excitement of feeling the gravity  and the accelleration around the corner  By the way  don t try corners this fast unless you are an experienced driver who is COMFORTABLE with your car and know its abilities and its limits  Handling  Well  let s just say this isn t your grandpa s Lincoln  The Mustang has a sport tuned suspension on it  As a result  when you go over bumps you are going to feel them  Don t buy the mustang if you want a smooth bump free ride  In fact  the Mustang has a very rough ride  Not only is it bumpy over the bumps  but at higher speeds  I have noticed a vibration that doesn t seem to go away  even when I get my tires rotated and balanced  Maybe that s just the factory Goodyear tires  which I might add totally suck   I now have 28 000 miles and there is very little tread left on the tires  and hopefully when I put some new ones on it  the car will ride a little smoother Safety  This car is one of very few cars in its class to receive a 5 star frontal crash rating  I know firsthand  I was a passenger in a 2001 Mustang Bullitt GT hard top  in an 80mph colission on the freeway  and I walked out of the car with only a few scratches  and didn t even have to go to the hospital  The driver also survived  but he had to spend a few nights in jail    The car  on the other hand  did not survive  and was totaled  Audio system  I got the premium option  so the Mach 460 sound system with 6 disc in dash CD changer is standard in this car  I love my Mach 460 sound  the bass is tight  the highs are crisp and clear  and even driving 80 on the freeway with the top down you can still hear the stereo just fine  The in dash CD changer is convenient  no more pulling over to change CD s  or fumbling under the seat to find the CD eject button  However  I have some huge complaints about the audio system  First of all  the speakers are cheaply installed  and vibrate excessively from the bass  Sometimes even with bass almost all the way off  the speakers still vibrate  which is very annoying and cheasy sounding  Secondly  I have had my in dash deck replaced once  and it already needs to be replaced again  You see  the CD changer has a problem ejecting CD s  and they get stuck  If you get this car  NEVER stick a CD with a paper label into the CD changer  it has a problem ejecting those  but even regular CD s can sometimes be a problem  especially those with raised artwork on the CD Comfort  Well  let s just say this car is meant for driver  and passenger in the front seat  If you are going to be transporting more people around  look elsewhere  This car is not comfortable to ride around in the back seat  I know I ve tried it personally  Also  another annoying thing  The leather seats in the front are real leather  but the back seat is just fake vinyl  That really annoyed me to pay extra for the leather  and only get it in the front seats  The leather seats in the front  however  are comfortable  and adequite for long trips  As many car magazines have stated  the seating position is awkward  and requires a lot of adjustment to find the perfect position  The driver seat has a LOT of adjustments  as it is a full 6 way power seat with electronic lumbar support  Once you find that perfect adjustment  the seat is great  Oh  by the way  did I mention you MUST get the leather seats  I ve driven Mustangs with the cloth seats and the fake vinyl ones in the rental cars  and they are EXTREMELY uncomfortable  so if you re going to buy this car  splurge and get the leather  I have had some problems with my seat  as I will describe under reliability Features  The mustang pretty much comes  loaded  especially if you get the premium model  However  the Mustang is a dated car  and is lacking some of the newer comfort and convenience features that cars today come standard with  For example  the leather seats are not heated  my friends 18 000 VW bug has heated leather seats  The climate control is manual  not electronic automatic  as found on the Acura 3 2CL Type S 24 000  The mirror is not  auto dimming  as found on some newer cars  The car has pretty much the basics you will need though   power windows  power door locks  remote keyless entry  cruise control  power driver passenger mirrors  remote trunk release  locking glove box  6 way power driver seat  6 disc in dash cd changer  6 speaker 460 watt sound system  and if you get the convertable  the top is fully electronic automatic  Another cool thing  and this is on all Ford cars and trucks  is the active anti theft system  Each Ford comes with a electronic key that has a computer chip in it  The car will only start with that key in the ignition  This means that your car can not be stolen  unless someone knows your key code and has another key made at the Ford dealership  The bad side is if you need to copy the key  it has to be done at Ford  and costs a lot to do Reliability  I have to admit  I am a little bit disapointed in this car  The engine and the transmision are SOLID  as expected from any Ford vehicle  FORDS ROCK  However  the car has a lot of annoying little squeeks and rattles  If you don t like squeeks and rattles  DO NOT GET THE CONVERTABLE  There is nothing they can do to fix squeeks and rattles  I ve had my car in the shop 3 times now to fix squeeks and rattles coming from the windows  and they just can t fix it  2 times  they had my car for almost 2 weeks trying to figure out how to fix the problems  My seat also has an ANNOYING squeek coming from the coil springs in the seat  kinda like a squeaky mattress  Every time I go around a corner  the seat squeaks  When I sit in it  it squeaks  I have taken it in for this 3 times  and my local Ford dealer s service department  North County Ford  absolutely SUCKS  They keep greasing the track that the seat is on  and won t listen to me when I tell them it s coming from INSIDE the seat  Hopefully  eventually  I can get them to replace my seat before the warranty is up  the squeak is very loud and annoying  Also  the power lumbar on my seat has failed  and no longer works  the button to increase or decrease the firmness does nothing  As stated in the audio section of my review  the cd changer has been replaced once  and now needs replacement again due to not ejecting discs  My oil pressure guage also went out intermittently   they quickly fixed that with a replacement sensor  So  I ve had some minor problems  which has been a huge annoyance  I m about to try taking my car to another Ford dealer to see if they can do a better job fixing my problems  Like I said though  Mechanically  the car is solid  and that s what is most important to me Overall  the car is a dream to drive  and I love every minute of this car  I wouldn t trade it for anything else  even with the little problems I ve had  I hope to get many more years of service  i ve had the car for about 18 months now  out of my pony  Oh  and about that high car payment  I went to e loan com and refinanced it  so I m down to  469 a month   MUCH BETTER UPDATE I put new tires on the car  as the factory ones were about worn out at 31 000 miles  I went with the Yokohama AVS ES 100 tires  They were 653 installed w  4 replacement certificates at Discount Tire  I went with a little bigger ones  as they didn t have 245 s in stock  so i went with the 255  The Yokohamas are a DREAM to ride with  Interior noise on the freeway has dropped at least 40  in the Mustang  And the tires stick to the road like glue  I highly recommend you replace your factory tires with these Yokohamas to allieviate some of my complaints addressed in this review Another update I traded the car into the Ford Dealer for a 2003 Ford Escape  I am now regretting it  as I really miss my mustang  but I gotta big dog to haul to the beach  which I got about a year after I bought my stang  and I am starting my own business  so I need something that I can haul stuff around in  the Mustang just wouldn t cut it  I ll miss my baby  It s been a fun ride  Make sure if you buy a mustang that you a  buy a used one to avoid the depreciation  and b  if it s your only form of transportation  make sure you won t have future needs such as hauling stuff around  or having kids  animals  etc  cuz the Mustang is not meant for that kinda stuff I guess I must be getting old  
 My 1994 Dodge 1500 SLT shortbed has an automatic  5 1 V8 and all the goodies  I bought this vehicle to pull my pontoon boat  It does an average job  but so did my Toyota 4 cylinder  It has been a maintenace nightmare  I have replaced the following items  Water pump  radiator  thermostat  4  times  upper and lower radiator hoses  fan belt  starter   amp  battery  twice  The seats are falling apart at the seams  the door rubber gaskets above the door have rotted away  The paint on the hood and top has turn to a sandy texture and peeled away  the truck is red  Gas mileage is around 10 mpg  The AM FM cassette deck quit working and when I removed it there was a sticker showing it has been repaired before  The parking brake lever will not engage  cruise control works sometime  The cigarette lighter quit working the passenger window only works from the drivers controls and the passenger seat sometimes comes unlocked and slides forward  The back of the truck is very light and I have been stuck twice is my own driveway in just plan dirt  I hate this truck and am getting rid of it  There are a few good things about it though  The A C is fantastic and here in Florida its great  The brakes are great  now with 118 000 miles on it it still makes me feel safe to drive it  Someone whom likes putting money into a vehicle should buy a Ram  Ram Tough  what a good sales slogan  I ll buy a used Chevy from now on br br  
 The Toyota Camry delivers on it s promise to be a reliable family car in every sense  Even the 132 horsepower 2 2 liter four cylinder has the zip to power the 3000 plus pound car up to speed when accessing the expressway or even when passing that truck up ahead  The four speed electronic transmission shifts are silky with no hesitation or jerky effects  Gas mileage is 30 highway and around town expect about 23 miles per gallon  Road sound is almost non existent with very good sound deadening  The interior appointments are plain yet clean  this is a no nonsense car for the long run  Our Camry was not perfect  the dealer wound up replacing the automatic transmission the second time the check engine light came on at 3000 miles  The difference was in the dealers support  we got another new Camry to drive totally free of charge and profuse apologies from the dealer for the inconvenience  Toyota knows how to keep a customer  something that can not be said for some other brands I know of  A summary statement for the Camry is that it is worth the extra cost  and will deliver over the long haul what you expect from a very competent piece of transportation br br  
 It s funny that one of the marketing slants on this car has been  quot Based on alien technology quot  And as hokey as it sounds  it s probably not far from truth   grin  From the exterior design and style that has made you rubberneck a few times as they whizzed by  to the ergonomics and sleek interior  Much thought went into this car  It s Volkswagen s offering of performance meets efficiency made accessible to the masses The GLX Turbo is quite simply AWESOME  IF you have the means  and are looking for performance then go ahead and try the five speed manual  Handling is very nice in cornering and an extra feature is the ASR Anti Slip Regulation for control in rain or any street conditions  This car really lets you get in touch with the driving experience and makes it a blast  The 1 8L Turbo offers great response in passing and very well out of 2nd and 3rd  A cool optional touch on the GLX Turbos reminiscent of the Corrados  for the VW devotees  is the mini spoiler that activates on or above 90mph  but with a manual override as well so you can play  Four speed drivers note  Gears are a  quot little taller quot    so this car likes to be wound out  And it will make you smile big when doing so  Its great fun to drive by yourself   or with friends  Although the back seat is not that roomy  its a trade off  there is great hauling space in the trunk  And NB prospective family members should also make note that on models with a moon roof   there is some wind vibration and noise if you do not open the moon roof to its ideal position Another noteworthy point  Upon arriving at my dealer  I was surprised to find a couple of models on the lot in both  quot reflex yellow quot  and  quot vapor quot  The advertised  quot web only available quot  colors  So contact as many dealers as you have in your area   you never know and it could mean getting that  quot hard to get quot  shade  I was in love with the metallic silver myself   but thats the beauty of it  They look great in all colors  And I m really pleased with getting this car loaded  Moonroof  turbo  full leather all add to the experience but in short   this car spells great fun no matter WHAT package you get My wife and I are now constantly fighting to drive ours so we re heading back to buy another ASAP  If that s not a singing endorsement  Very well done VW  Kudos BG Creative Director   Web Developer Tucson  AZ   
 Well  as of December of 1999  I have been driving the Civic Si  I am over all pleased with the car 100  I have had a few minor flaws in the car  but they are all bound to happen no matter what you buy  This car has a lot of power for the size and also the steering is outstanding  The steering is extremely tight which makes it hug the curves extremely tight  I can go around a curve at a good amount of speed and I will not hear one screech come from the tires  The low profile Michelins that they put on the car go with the aspect of the car as well as the handling the car needs  I am very hard on cars  And so far  the car has been able to stand up to the Rhode Island roads which are considered to be the worst in the country  The clutch is so smooth making the gear box just want to give the car more and more power as u drive on  And for passing speed there is left over power in the car in 5th gear to pass a car when doing 80mph  I was amazed at how well the car felt on the road  in my hands  and how it looks  I would convince all my friends and anyone in the world to by this car over any car in its class br br  
 When I bought my 1992 Sundance in 1998 I was a bit worried at first because it was a used car  which we know had previously been in an accident  The new front end and hood could have told us that  and because I had never financed a car before  After I got it there was about  1500 worth of work that needed to be done  specifically a new starter  new evaporator  A C part  new cam seals  the dome light needed to be rewired from the ground up  the speedometer wiring was screwed up and the exhaust needed to have a couple parts replaced  My Dad is a master mechanic of 28 years experience and I know quite a bit about cars myself  A new starter isn t unusual after 6 years  nor is a new exhaust pipe and the cam seals usually fail based on how hard the car was driven before  so I can t speak to those three aspects  However  if you get a Sundance I will forewarn you that the air conditioner will likely be toast in 2 3 years because evaporators and condensers tend to die on those things very quickly  The rest of the problems could have just been caused by things going bad like they sometimes do The work was done under warranty for free so I didn t pay a cent of that  1500  My Dad and I both own Sundances  He owns a 91 and I own a 92  Both of them seem to be pretty good cars mechanically  at least compared to some  but now the head gasket is going bad on mine and his has been bad for over a year  This is supposedly a common problem to Sundances  One more problem with mine  was that the hood flew up at 70 mph on the freeway  but this was likely due to the fact that the hood had been replaced after the aforementioned accident and the people that replaced it did some bad work and forgot to tighten a few bolts completely Ok  so it needs some work  Really though  the car runs great with the exception that it needs a bit of work  For a  5000 car I ve seen worse  Much worse  It s easy to work on  so if you re a fix it yourself kind of person you can easily get around the engine  the body  if well taken care of will  It s a great first car because it s easy to get used to driving and you re not out a fortune if you wreck it  It could even be a good  long lasting car if you take good care of it  but maintenance is the key  If you start missing oil changes 2 or 3 times over  and neglect to check your fluids or your belts and hoses  no car will last  The Sundance is no exception to this rule  Overall it s a really good car if you re looking for something economical and that looks nice br br  
 I got the explorer sport because my sister s lease was up and the price was pretty good  but it really has been great for everything that I ve needed  As a college student in the northeast that often needs to move a car load of stuff or people but don t really want to be driving a boat this car has filled my needs perfectly As far as the engine and other particulars everything has performed to my satisfaction  I don t know all the benefits or what they give me  but I have never felt that it was underpowered or had any major service problems  I did need to get a new clutch  at 38 000 miles  put in  but that was because it had not been driven correctly  It s important to know that the explorer sport truly is a truck in sheep s clothing  Although it has a nice interior and all that good stuff  it feels like a truck as it accelerates and grips the road  I have really like this aspect of the car because I feel more control  Even still I don t feel tossed around when I hit a bump or something What I ve really like about it has been how well it works with my needs  I can easily give people rides places and still have a totally full back  I would not say that the back two seats are very comfortable  When going on a roadtrip  the back seat is a little undesirable but totally functional  On shorter trips the back seat is fine  It officially holds two people  with seatbelts  but three can squeeze easily br br  
 We have had our Contour a year and a half now  We wanted a small family car  front wheel drive  and a standard transmission  When we saw this Contour on the lot the last standard in it s class we loved the look  When we saw what it offered inside we liked it even more  We took it for a test drive and before we arrived back at the dealership  we knew we were going to take it  The price was already right so we didn t have to do much bargaining for it  We had previously owned a Ford Tempo  The Contour has been the best car we ve ever had  We re looking to trade again this fall and I m sure we ll look at the Contour s first  The smooth driving  low maintenance  and affordability are what make this car the right one  I think small families  one or two children  are the best people for this car  The backseat could fit three children  but it would be tight on a long vacation  It s also sporty enough for a single person who is looking for the sporty look     
 I ve owned my 1998 Windstar GL for just over two years now  My previous vehicle was a 1991 Dodge Caravan  In comparison  The Windstar has much more comfortable seats  and a better ride  It also feels much more stable than my old Caravan  The Windstar also has the benefits of anti lock brakes and traction control both of which have come in handy during the snowy winter months My Windstar came equipped with the 3 8 liter V 6  While this engine has gobs of torque  it sucks fuel down with equal voracity  In normal driving around town it only gets 17 MPG  and the best it s done on the highway is 20MPG  I was used to the Caravan s 3 0 liter getting 20 MPG around town and 24 or so on the highway  The Windstar s gas mileage is in SUV territory  I even took it in for service and was told that the mileage I was getting was normal  The 3 0 liter engine may be the way to go for better mileage Other than the poor mileage  I haven t had any other problems with the vehicle  It currently has 21 000 miles on the odometer br br  
 Two months ago I traded in my 1996 Chevy Cavalier  Thank God It cost us thousands to get out of that mess let s see  where do I begin The car only had 37 000 miles on it   note the warranty ran out at 36 000  From the start the car had electrical problems  Fuses always blowing and battery s always dying  This car saw  3  brand new batteries  The dash and center shift console came loose by 20 000 and the driver seat broke  This car was babied and the driver is thin 500 miles after the warranty ended the cassette deck broke  the trunk release and again  the electrical problems were back  This car rattled and sounded like a tank  At times the engine would lose 1 2 it s power for no reason Overall  I was very dissatisfied and almost felt taken Let s just say it was as bad as a bad investment  I might as well have burned the 36 months of payments and the HUGE down payment Bye Bye little red Cavalier br br  
 I recently rented a Kia Sephia while some work was being done on my car  I looked forward to trying out the Kia since I m considering purchasing another car soon  I was sadly disappointed  I was impressed with the visibility through the windshield and the amount of space in the interior of the car  However  living in Alaska as I do  there is often ice or snow on the roads  I was disappointed with the way the Kia handled  It seemed to lose traction much too easily and I found it difficult to regain control  Possibly  better tires might have helped  While the price of the Kia is good  it s easy to see where they skimped on the car  The interior looks cheap  and the body of the car seems very thin and light  That  combined with the poor handling did not bode well if I was in an accident  This car would be good for someone that doesn t have to deal with slippery road conditions who is just starting out br br  
 I ll start by saying I own a 1996 Acura 2 5 TL which is a great car  but I ve had it for 5 1 2 years and just purchased a 2003 Acura 3 2 TL Type S  The color I chose was the metallc white diamond pearl exterior as it offers a tan interior and only the tan interiors offer the real wood like  although it s not real wood  that s only in the RL  look inside  In a nutshell the car is magnificent  Each time I am getting ready to drive it I smile it s just so much fun  First let s talk quality it s made by Honda that should give you piece of mind  Next  interior layout  Don t listen to what others say about it being similar to the accord  My wife has a 2002 Honda Accord EX V6  very nice  but the two interiors are different and the Acura s is noticeably more luxurious and differently laid out  Remember  if it were completely different  you d pay for that  Honda Acura do a good job of differentiating these two cars even though they are built on the same platform  The Bose 5 speaker  6 CD in dash cd cass stereo with a nice subwoofer mounted in the back is magnificent  If you are a complete music nut  I m sure you could find something to complain about the stereo  but trust me  I love my music and this stereo is great  The leather interior is soft and luxurious the Type S has perforated leather on the two front seats and on the doors to give it a sporty look  The only option on the car is the navigation  All standard for this  31 000 sedan are leather seats  memory seats  heated seats  heated mirrors  power moonroof  both passenger and driver s power seats  6 CD in dash  Xenon lights  the ones that let off that light blue  which acutally gives the driver more light and is less bright to oncoming traffic  fog lights  260 hp  232 lb ft  torque VTEC V6  a superb digital auto climate control  traction control  steering control  tiptronic  lets you manually shift gears if you d like to give you the feeling of driving a standard  although the car only comes in automatic  dual front and side air bags  ABS  etc  etc  etc  That s a lot of car for  31 000  The only option on the car is the navigation system for about  2 100 and from what I hear it s a gem  however  unless you travel a lot to places you don t know  you re better off saving the  2 100 and taking a vacation or simply wasting it on gas in the new TL Type S  which may not be a farse you ll be filling up a lot as it s just a joy to drive this car I do not believe there is a car that looks as nice in the TL s class  The 17 inch  five spoke wheels on the TL Type S make the car look even more beautiful Performance   let s just say  if you look at the Type S  you know it moves  but you think of it more as a nice looking luxury sedan  That all changes when you put your pedal down while listening to your favorite CD on the Bose system  The car flys and I mean FLYS  The best thing  in addition to the nicer tires  much stiffer suspension  more torque and 35 more horsepower  about the Type S over the regular TL is the rumble from the larger tail pipes  the exhaust on the Type S is a little larger than those of the regular TL  As the car changes it s gears the rumble in the mufflers sounds perfect  It s a luxury sedan so remember  it isn t going to sound like a corvette  but it lets you and those driving near the car know there s something very special under the hood  that being a robust 3 2L 260 horsepower  232 lb ft  torque VTEC engine that loves to be pushed  At 80 mph  the tach  RPMs  or revs per thousand  is just at 2 100 meaning the engine is simply not working hard at all  meaning the car can go extremely fast  In short  you will be amazed at how quick this car is  The nice tires and much stiffer suspension on the Type S over the regular TL  make it a very fun car to drive  The handling is superb for a front wheel drive vehicle  Acura does a good job of making the car feel more like an all wheel drive when it comes to handling the handling is stiff  and that s exactly how you d like it with 260 ponies under the hood of a car that weighs approx  3 550 lbs  One more time  although the car is luxurious and very stylish  in Acura s reserved  but always perfect way  the car hauls  I had brand new 1993 Mustang LX 5 0 trust me  the TL Type S is faster key is  the Type S will likely outlive you  as for the fords  chevys  etc  etc  um  I don t think so Finally  safety  I have a child under two and just transferred the car seat from the 2 5 TL over to the new TL Type S  Standard is the latch system  both attached to the frame under the seats and the hooks on top of the seats  Also  for piece of mind  there is a release in the trunk  should your kids be horsing around and playing hide and go seek and hide in the trunk  Likely not  but just in case  Dual front air bags  dual side air bags  traction control  ABS  solid frame  steering assistance  etc  and good scores on all crash ratings make the 2003 Acura 3 2 TL Type S a very safe car  Here s another cool safety feature when you put the car in reverse  the passenger mirror actually adjusts automatically so that you can see behind you in an effort to reduce the risk of backing into something once you take the car out of reverse  it automatically re adjusts  pretty neat Let s see  if you want to buy a car in the  29 000 to  32 000 range  and would like luxury  performance  quality  safety  style  good warranty  etc then run to your nearest Acura dealership now and take this car for a drive you won t believe how well priced it is for all you get be careful  once you take it off the lot for a drive  chances are  you ll likely be bringing it home for good it s a great car and did I mention extremely fast  
 The ubiquitous minivan is frequently sold on consumer feel good items such as the placement and size of cup holders  the presence of map pockets or the number of zones in which the climate control can be split   Ford s 2000 Windstar  does well on these creature comfort areas  but excels in safety and reliability   critical areas for the family oriented minivan market segment  I just spent a week driving the Windstar through a variety of street and weather conditions  This is the third minivan I ve test driven in the last five months  and so far  is my favorite  I still haven t driven the  Honda Odyssey  which has better all around numbers  but the  Windstar performs better than the Plymouth Grand Voyager and its Dodge Caravan twin   Since this was Dodge s baby to begin with  that s a hard statement to write  but Ford has done a terrific job with this van b THE RIDE  Feel the acceleration  The Windstar has plenty of get up and go  There s a 3 8 liter V6 with 200 hp  more of both than the Odyssey or the Grand Caravan  This van has torque to spare with 240 foot pounds at 3600 rpm  again better than both vehicles  I found myself passing slower moving vehicles with just a tap on the responsive accelerator  There was always plenty of power left over to respond to changing road conditions I also found the ride itself to be smooth  The Windstar weighs a good 100 pounds more than the Grand Voyager  and although neither are in serious big SUV territory at just under 4000 pounds  they are solid  The Windstar s wheelbase is bigger than I would have liked  at over 120 inches  contributing to a bigger than expected turning radius  Several times I found myself faced with the choice of making a three point turn or doing some curb cutting  I knew that acceleration was there for some reason The Windstar s critics have complained of the same top heavy  swaying feeling I found in the Grand Voyager   I didn t find much swaying at all  even when accelerating in curves   In fact  the biggest criticism I could find on the ride was that there is a small but significant blind spot just off the right rear bumper  Some jiggling with mirrors restricted from field of vision to other sides  but stopped me from driving several smaller cars off the road b SAFETY  Let s face it  Families buy minivans  And along with reliability  family buyers treasure safety above every other attribute  Airbags  including side airbags  are standard on this vehicle  but that only comprises a small portion of safety  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA or http www nhtsa gov  is the agency responsible for crash testing vehicles for the federal government  They gave the Windstar 5 stars out of a possible 5 for crash worthiness  A safety group run for the insurance industry  the Highway Loss Data Institute  found that the addition of the side air bags made the Windstar one of the safest passenger van in its 40 mph crash tests  The van finished third behind the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey in their tests  This was actually a step down for the Windstar  which used to be rated as best in its class  but the Odyssey s redesign catapulted the 2000 model over the Windstar  Still  these three vehicles were the only ones to receive HLDI s overall  good  rating in their class Self sealing tires and a reverse sensor system that alerts the driver when the rear bumper is within five feet of something are safety options that are well worth considering  Ford has packaged multiple options into several safety packages  so depending on what you want to put on your van  you might find it cheaper to buy a package than to add single options b CREATURE COMFORTS  The very first thing I noticed when I settled into the driver s seat was the ledge over the window well  It s a perfect height for resting a driver s arm  yes  I know you should drive with two hands on the wheel  These little things  like the aforementioned cup holders and map pockets  make a surprising amount of difference in overall consumer protection  And speaking of the cup holders  the two recessed under the ashtray in the front were adjustable and fit different sized cups with a simple squeeze of the ratcheted plastic ring  I was very impressed with the interior lighting  which gave plenty of directed illumination at night without making it difficult to continue driving  Even the climate controls for the passengers in the rear two rows are illuminated at night   a nice feature that not every minivan shares The stereo was big and bold sounding with the requisite tuning and pseudo equalizer buttons  I particularly liked the oversized radio station buttons The stems off the steering wheel were the only item that caused me concern  On the right side stem  the driver finds the gear shift lever with the overdrive button recessed into the tip  That s simply annoying design  but the dangerous design is on the left side stem which controls turn signals and dual interval wiper systems  On more than one occasion  I signaled for a left turn only to unexpectedly spray the windshield with fluid and start the wipers  The turn signal control is a silly place to put a wiper button anyway  That said  the dual interval wipers are neat and do a tremendously good job in maintaining visibility through even heavy rain Interior visibility is terrific  however  thanks to a mini mirror that swings down between the driver and passenger seats in front  This is not intended as a rear view mirror  but as a way to watch folks even in the back row  Parents with kids are going to love this feature because it doesn t detract at all from the rear view mirror and is easily seen from either driver or passenger seat Finally  the killer comfort issue was found on the fourth door  Yes  the Windstar is available as a four door unit too  perfect for families who can enter on driver or passenger side  I also found that the bucket seats in the second row were nice and roomy while the third row bench seat easily folded down or was removed   THE BOTTOM LINE  Auto dealers are still getting near sticker price for the Honda Odyssey  last year s minivan darling  If price is a factor at all  I find that the Windstar stacks up very favorably against the Odyssey and now is the time to buy 2000 models since the 2001s are now in stock  Ford is also trying to move the 2000 units and

 I bought a 540i with the sport package  navigation  premium stereo  and fold down seats in February 2001  The car has been very reliable and fun to drive  It is the perfect blend of sportiness and comfort The car has excellent looks  mine is black on black  I think it looks as sporty and aggressive as anything on the road aside from a Porsche 911  The car drives as fast as you can comfortably stand take it  while providing ample comfort and thoughtful conveniences  I had previously owned a 1993 325is  manual  which was an excellent car  The 540i is a better car in almost every way  without taking anything away from the unique desirable qualities of the 3 Series  I never really consider other makes  I like the 9 3 and 9 5  but am not sold on SAAB s reliability  even though improvements have been made  Lexus and Mercedes aren t as sporty I added the BMW Motorola phone which was expensive  about  2 000  but well worth it  Make sure that you buy the compensator and hand s free kit  My system is so clear that clients think that I am in the office when I use it  The ability to work the phone from the steering wheel is a great feature  as well as the hands free aspect Reliability is important to me  My only problems after 32 000 miles have been  paint chipped off of back trunk lid and chips too easily in the front hood area of the car  the dealer perfectly fixed the problem on the trunk lid at no cost  an electronic diode failed on the climate control system  but was fixed easily  the BMW phone cradle shorted out and had to be replaced  the window seals get dry at times and cause too much noise  Not much the dealer could do  they replaced the window regulator on one side  and all of the seals  but nothing really helped much  the fold down seats were a little loose when latched  but the dealer fixed it so they are completely rigid and quiet  a few times the car s autostart feature would crank but not start the car  No fault was detected  and the problem has gone away These items were all fixed by the dealer quickly  with no hassle at all  And they provided transportation to and from my work through a shuttle or free rental I recommend the sports suspension  although if you regularly commute over rough freeways  you might want to consider the standard suspension  which also has the standard torque converter which adds about 3 MPG to your mileage The navigation works well  although sometimes it doesn t have an address correctly  The air conditioning works great  even when going to Palm Springs in the summer  This is the only car that I have owned that keeps putting out cold air even at plus 100 degrees The back seat is fine  unless you regularly drive around very tall passengers  The 540i is a much more refined car than the 3 Series  yet has the luxury of the 7 Series  I would only get the 7 Series if you regularly drive around a lot of clients  or just want a bigger car aimed at bigger  less sporty ride  The old 7 Series is not as fast as the 540i Gas mileage has not been good  at about 12   14 MPG city  and 21   23 highway  The sports suspension torque converter takes its toll on mileage  I think  
 Full Review Ford Taurus SEL 2002 NoBull  The Ford Taurus SEL Wagon 2002 is an example that a car manufacturer can put out a vehicle that will surpass government recommended safety standards and still be a very attractive and stylish automobile  Ever since a coworker bought a Taurus Wagon and rode in it  I always have been very impressed by this car  I thought that not only it looked very nice on the exterior but also that the interior was very practical  stylish and comfortable  Ford has equipped the 2002 Taurus with a series of safety features that makes it one of the safest cars on the road  Some of the safety features includes dual stage front air bags  crash severity sensor  safety belt pre tensioners  safety belt energy management retractors  safety belt usage sensors and driver seat position sensor  With all those innovative safety features it is no wonder that the US government has giving the Ford Taurus a Five Star Crash Test Rating  the highest mark a car can receive for crash test safety testing  The newly design cabin will give occupants an added two inches in rear seat headroom and a full inch in front seat headroom  The front seats are very comfortable even more on the driver side  which is equipped with a six way power driver s seat adjustment including a very good and appreciated manual lumbar adjustment  The interior of the car I drove had a very beautiful and stylish color combination  The seats and door panels were creme with medium dark grey dashboard and trims and the carpet was a light brown  the color scheme really looked smart and was very pleasing to the eyes  The Taurus Wagon can sit 8 passengers so claims Ford  but if you are thinking of 8 adults you will be stuffed in like sardines  Once you open up the fold down rear seats  you have no more room for cargo  I did feel that for a station wagon even with that rear seat down you had very little space for luggage and equipment  The exterior of 2002 Taurus Wagon has very beautiful lines and all its components are very proportionate to each other s  The color of the car I test drove was an eye catching Harvest Gold protected with a Metallic Clearcoat  One things I liked is how high the rear gate opens to allow you to load the cargo  this will definitely helps preventing people from banging their head on the rear gate  The 2002 Taurus Wagon is a real pleasure to drive either within city limits or on the high roads  I had the opportunity to drive it on an extended trip on one of upstate New York most scenic highway  The ride was excellent and the scenery was breathtaking  I really appreciated how well the Taurus wagon hugged the road and how comfortable you are it this car  The Taurus SEL Wagon comes equipped with 4 wheel disc brakes anti lock system and a new Electronic Brake Distribution system mounted on a Power adjustable brake and accelerator kit which makes it easy to find the proper way to adjust the pedals and seat to the driver s choice  N The Taurus SEL Wagon I drove was equipped with a V6 DOHC 24 valve  3 liters  The transmission is an electronic 4 speed automatic overdrive  It had a 4 wheel discs  anti lock system  The sitting capacity is for 8 passengers and the cargo volume is 82 cubic feet  Driving the Ford Taurus SEL Wagon was a real charm  I went for a drive on some of the most scenic roads in North America and what a sight with the Fall foliage turning from green to red  brown and gold and this beautiful gold automobile simply faded in with the natural decor  
 I bought my car  1993 Ford Probe  in the summer of 1998 from a used car dealer in my area for  6000  It wasnt too expensive at the time for a college student  I realized i could have gotten the GT for the same price at another place  Anyways  during that summer I really didnt have anything go wrong with it  only except to get 2 new tires and a few other minor things  I really didnt start having trouble with it until that winter  Me living in Maine  we get alot of snow and the roads arent as good  I found that because the car is so light overall espically in the back end  it was hard to drive in the winter  I would lose control of my car alot  As time went on  I had alot of other problems including electical and exhaust  I recently had to get a whole new exhaust  spent  400  I also had to get a new distributor cap and wires which cost me a few hundred dollars as well  When getting that fixed i was told that my axle needs to be replaced as well I have had nothing but problems with this car  Even though the style of the car is very nice looking and it appeals to the eye and if you feel like you can add things to make it better  i highly recommend you NOT get this car espcially if you are a broke college student trying just to get by  I have had alot of problem with this  Unless you are willing and have the money to spend  then DO NOT get this car  I have talked to alot of other probe owners as well and they also say that they have had bad things happen to them as well  I highly recommend you do not get this car br br  
 I purchased my Infiniti I 30 a little over one year ago  I had actually shopped a dealership on line and had looked at Toyota and Honda products  I had done the research on those makes   models and hadn t even looked into an Infiniti Upon arriving at the dealership  I test drove the cars I had previewed on line and my socks were not knocked off by a long shot  I was driving a  97 Volkswagon Passat at the time and had grown accustomed to the heavier car  smoother ride  and high quality leather interior not to mention a cavernous trunk The Infiniti caught my eye  however  and with my trade in  the cash I had to put down  and a credit rating that I ve worked hard for  the dealership was willing to work a deal with me My initial reaction to the Infiniti has remained as I continue to drive the car  As a mom and a person who spends alot of time in her car  there are certain qualities about this car that sets it apart from other cars I ve owned b Exterior Qualities  The body of this car is not as distinct as some other models  but it is a solid car that looks good from all angles  I appreciate the safety features associated with the car s front lights including a  turning  light which illuminates and stays on when the turn signal is engaged allowing greater visibility in the turning direction Although I was completely enthralled with my Volkswagon Passat s trunk  I find the Infiniti s to be  almost  as impressive  I may not be able to pack in as many things  but the amount of storage it offers is remarkable considering the amount of space inside the automobile and that it is a sedan sized auto b Interior Qualities  Where to even begin  The Infiniti offers a buttery leather interior with sharp looking control panel and dash  Although the buttons take some getting used to and can be awkward to reach  practice does make perfect  The automatic window controls also seem to operate in a  backward  fashion to me  but it isn t a deal breaker  The seats are extremely comfortable and adjust to any desired position  Although I have only ridden in the backseat a few times  I know that it can become a bit cramped during long car rides  It does  however  properly hold car seats and offer ample room for them My particular car has a double drink holder  Also not a deal maker or breaker  but important to those who have kids in the car more often than not  The Bose sound system in my particular car is especially enjoyable  I have a CD player and a cassette player which makes driving even more pleasurable for me  The quality of sound and the sheer volume that can be achieved are worth mentioning b Driving the Infiniti I 30  I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience of driving this car  I appreciate the quick acceleration  large turning radius  and responsive braking system  I have found the Infiniti to have better than average gas mileage which is important since it s luxury car denotation requires the premium grade gasoline Again  the feeling of security in this car is readily felt  It offers a heaviness that cars in this class do  but without the noise  clunkiness or boxiness associated with other makes I ve looked at or ridden in since b Possible Cons  The only one I could see here is cost  The Infiniti can be cost prohibitive depending on the year and model you consider  However  in the long run  you may consider the Infiniti as the old adage of getting what you pay for usually holds true If you do your research and find a quality used Infiniti  you could easily save yourself the endless cash draining possibilities of another used make  I have a friend who inherited her parent s eleven year old Infiniti and even in Chicago driving has never been disappointed  With routine maintenance  large scale repairs would almost be completely avoidable  Yes  parts do cost more for a car like this  but they also last so much longer b The Final Thought  If presented with a used Infiniti  feel confident in your purchase  The research you have done  the feedback from satisfied owners  and the positive industry talk can t all be wrong  
 This is the fourth Corolla I have owned in the last 12 years  and I love it  Technically  I don t really  quot own quot  the vehicle  as we lease it  but by leasing  I know that every 3 years I m going to be getting a new car and its something I look forward to  This time  I was convinced that I was going to  quot upgrade quot  to a Camry  but after shopping around  I found that for the money we were prepared to pay  I would end up with the very base model  but if I stayed with the Corolla  it would be  quot loaded quot I am now driving around in a Silver LE with spoiler  sun roof  cruise control  tilt wheel  and front and side airbags  just to name a few features  The ride is extremely smooth with little outside noise  Gas mileage was also a big factor for me as we do a lot of highway traveling  including round trip from New England to Florida each year  I know the car isn t  quot broken in quot  as yet  but so far I have been averaging 36 mpg on the highway  Not bad  considering the price of gas these days  About the only thing I dont like about the vehicle is the comfort of the seats on a long drive  They are fine for short trips  but anything over an hour and my back starts to hurt  I have a pillow that I keep in the car for that purpose and that pretty much solves the problem  but it would be nice if they would install the lumbar adjustments in the seats like my husband has in his Chevrolet S10  I highly recommend the Corolla for all around value and know that this probably wont be the last one I ll call my own     
 I traded in my Lexus   so I m new to SUV s and American made vehicles  But I was looking for something that would give me more flexibility and was fun to drive the 2002 Escape fit the bill  I first test drove the sister SUV the Mazda Tribute and was instantly hooked  When I started doing research I discovered that Ford sold the identical  minor trim changes  vehicle but usually at a lower price   and Ford was offering much better financing terms and more for my trade in A week after taking delivery on my 2002 XLT V6 with leather interior and the premium sound system  I went on a 4 day road trip and must say that overall I found the truck very comfortable  very economical  and fun to drive  There is considerably more road noise than with my Lexus   but I figured it was just because you are sitting up so much higher and you have all that trim and luggage rack that adds to the wind noise  I have read several reviews that talk about engine noise   I have heard none   just wind noise at high speeds  I do have a complaint about the placement of the steering column shifter   it does block easy access to the volume button on the radio   but once you get use to it   not a problem  There is lot s of cargo space which I have really enjoyed   a nice retractable cargo cover  and an adjustable luggage rack  I guess I m spoilt by the Lexus   but I find the carpets in my Escape to be a little skimpy   I just keep reminding myself that it s a truck  The leather seats are comfortable by not luxurious  the stereo on the other hand is actually better than the Lexus   great system  I like to drive with my headlights on and the 2002 comes with auto lights out after about 2 minutes but the irritating thing is the dinger still sounds when you leave the lights on  I don t see the point of having an auto lights out feature if the alarm is going to sound  
 I bought this vehicle because of the room it offers  I have a family that consists of 5 people and it has fit everyone comfortably  I love this car because it has power and it is a real comfortable ride  I feel so free and happy when I drive this car  The thing that I hate about this vehicle is that I ve already had to put in a transmission  The cost for this would have been 1600 dollars if they didn t offer me the 70 000 mile warranty that was in my owners manual but I heard they  dealers  don t honor this warranty anymore  People with families should buy this car because they will find that this car will satisfy all their needs  I think that everyone should have the chance to drive or own on of these cars     
 This is also about my first car  a 1992 Eagle Vista  same prototype as a Dodge Colt  different name  After seeing this car in its present condition  many asked me why I bought this car  The reasons are as follows  1  price    1000 CAN  cheap when you think about it especially considering my financial situation 2  mileage   only 90 000 kms on it 3  history    related to 2  This car has only had 1 owner  my brother in law  who has been a long time cop and  because he often drove cruisers and police vehicles  he rarely had to drive his Vista 4  interior   despite seeming very compact at first  if a car s too roomy  I get lost inside  once you put the back seat down  a lot more room becomes available  I should know as I slept rather comfortably back there once 5  economical   between  20 and  30 CAN gets you 45 liters of gas that lasts anywhere from 400   500 kms in the city to 700   800 kms on the highway 6  power   surprising get up and go from a smallish 1 5 L  4 cylinder Mitsubishi engine Now comes the interesting history of my little  speeder  In the eight years that my brother in law owned this car     it was in two serious accidents and one minor one  severe body work required  the first engine blew up once on the highway  engine replaced  and the second slowly died last fall  engine replaced again Despite the major  operations  that have been required for this car  I will probably drive it until the third engine dies  at which point I should be able to afford a new car  Why  you ask   Well  for one thing  there is a lot of sentimental attachment to this car  My brother in law drove it for 5 years and my sister drove it for 5 and they have both been through a lot with it  Also  this is my first car so of course I love it with all my heart  Finally  it performs exceptionally well in extreme conditions such as Canadian winters  always starts immediately once the key is turned  it takes a while but once the heater gets going in the winter  I end up having to take off my jacket if I m in the car for an extended period of time    However  now that these major things have been done will be done  the car is mechanically sound and runs beautifully  The new shocks and bodywork are just so I can keep my dignity  I LOVE MY CAR   Future plans for the car     complete bodywork  Spring Summer 2001  don t worry  I m getting a deal   new shocks  Spring Summer 2001 
 This review is an update to a previous draft  and has been completely re written  When I wrote the first review  I d only owned the car for three days  Now  it s been over a month  and my opinion still has not changed  Let me outline below a few key points about the Focus Styling and Interior Okay  okay  So the Ford Focus isn t cute by anyone s standards  Well  maybe a few  but not many  The exaggerated wheel wells  sloped hood  and rearward narrowed body style of the Focus definitely sets it apart from most cars  With your eyes squinted  it kinda looks like a VW Jetta  but that s all  Overall though  I think the Focus looks tough  and you can tell almost immediatly that the Focus offers more ground clearance than most cars in its class The interior is thoughfully laid out  with all the controls within easy reach of the driver  and feels natural as well  The only exception to that rule is the park break  which is wedged underneath the center storage console  Ford obviously anticipated this and made the console swivel 90 degrees upright  but even then I find myself having to lean to the left slightly to get a comfortable grip on the handle  Granted  that s coming from a guy who s six feet even and 225 pounds Zip  Punch  and Oomph Let s be honest here   below 2 000 rpms  First Gear is gutless  and below about 3 800 rpms  so is Fifth  Second  Third  and Fourth  though  offer an excellent torque curve and accelerate the car nicely  With the air conditioner on full blast  the Focus does indeed take a hefty hit to performance  but with the manual gearbox this can be compensated simply by shifting at higher rpms  As far as hills are concerned   my opinion here has changed since my draft review  I stated previously that the Focus was indeed challenged by steep inclines  but at the time I hadn t really driven any  Since then I ve had the chance to drive my Focus up a really steep incline   to be specific  Guardsman s Pass in Park City  Utah  The first three miles of this road   the paved section   is a 10  15  grade  That last three miles   arguably unpaved   is a 20    30  grade  To give you an idea how steep this road is  it s a ski slope in the winter  Literally  you drive under a ski lift on your way up  The Focus handled the road beautifully  shifting between First and Second gear and occassionaly Third when the road flattened out for a few feet  Remember  this was done with the Air Conditioner off  and honestly  ANY vehicle would have trouble going up this road with the AC on Handling Holy smokes  Here is where the Focus really shines  and after driving if for awhile I wasn t surprised to learn that the Ford Focus took Fourth Place in the international rally championship in France  This car seriously corners like it s on rails  To give you an example The trip I mentioned earlier  to Park City  included three separate canyons  For anyone familiar with Utah  these were Weber  Morgan  and Parley s  The canyons offer several consecutive miles of turns  ranging from 35   55 mph ratings  Parley s Canyon is arguably the most dangerous stretch of road in Utah  each yeah claiming numerous lives in its gulleys and embankments  Under normal driving conditions   which means staying in your chosen lane all the way through the turn   I rarely had to slow down anymore than 70 miles per hour  and usually stayed around 75  This was with no tense moments  I m not a professional and I don t do controlled skids  There was no drift  no squeal  no nothing  During another trip through these canyons  I found myself in the wonderful position of being the only car on the road  During that trip  I was able to  bobsled  the turns  where you come into the turn high  drift low around the middle  and drift back to high towards the end of the turn  Driving like this  I was able to tackle all three canyons no slower than 80  and usually 85   90  That s with no AM or HP parts   that s stock suspension and tires Someone earlier made the statement  The Ford Focus will take a curvy road and make it straight  and from personal experience I can tell you they were dead on the money Gas Mileage What s the say  It seems the sticker was right concerning freeway   right around 30   33 mpg  I haven t had a chance to really test it for city driving  as most of my driving involves a heavy amount of freeway  It should be noted here too that the Focus was comfortable for a longer drive   the Park City trip was 150 miles there and back  and I made that drive three times in as many days  I plan to take a long road trip with it sometime in the Spring  from Utah to Missouri  and after that trip I ll post a review regarding how it handled for long road trips Overall I m amazed   that s all I can say  I know six people now who are planning to buy a Focus in the near future after riding in mine  and I plan to keep mine for the life of the car  
 I bought my red Ford Ranger off of my Uncle while I was looking mostly at cars  Trucks had always appealed to me  and I have driven quite a few   95 F 150  98 Silverado  98 F 150 most recently  I ve been in an S 10 before and seen someone else drive it  been under the hood of the S 10 as well  This truck appealed to me  however When I got the truck  it had 148 000 miles on it  It had no rust  was virtually dentless  ran smoothly and was well maintained  though my uncle had a blast with it and drove it a lot The engine got to me the most  Though Chevy did offer a 4 3 L V 6 in a similar size frame  many S 10s lacked the muscle and truckiness of the Ranger  Most S 10 s came with 4 cyl s  and the ones I have looked at were badly underpowered  When you threw in the 4 3  it became a mechanical nightmare it seemed  So my Ranger and I went home and got acquainted  20 000 miles later  it still runs like I just bought it  I ve had little problems with it  and have taken it on a couple long hauls  It can handle a load and still has plenty of spunk on the highway  The only problem comes from a bumpy ride at higher speeds Overall  a tough truck  I drove the heck out of it and it still refused to break down on me  Some basic maintenance was needed in the spring  though  The power steering unit started to give out  giving my Ranger the nickname  Wookie  for the growling noises it produced as I turned the wheel With a lot of work  nearly two days  I had to disassemble what seemed like half of the front end to get the part out I needed out and have the new unit put together  With such a large engine comes a tremendous mechanical hassle as you try to repair it Despite this  this vehicle is easy to maintain  oil changes are effortless  and it is very easy and forgiving to drive  It takes a beating and keeps running Overall  I would recommend this vehicle for its truckiness  It is more trucklike than any similar year light pickup  It carries more power and has a fair amount of speed about it  as well as maintaining a good  solid level of dependability  
 The 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a wonderful and useful automobile  I originally purchased this vehicle because I truly need a sport utility  I needed a vehicle which could haul some  would be good in the snow if needed  could travel offroad without getting stuck in muddy ground  that could tow a trailer and that could also haul 4 or 5 people in comfort to a movie or dinner outing if necessary  This vehicle provides all this and more My Grand Cherokee is equipped with the 5 2 litre V8  the towing package  heated leather seats  etc  It is the Limited model  which came very well equipped  This vehicle is very smooth and quiet on the road  and is excellent for traveling on long trips  The automatic climate control A C is one of the best that I have experienced  and it has excellent brakes The only noticeable difference in driving  as opposed to a standard sedan  is that you will feel a little more leaning during cornering or perhaps a little more sway  This is due to the tall tires and high center of gravity  I might add  though  that when it comes to off roading  there isnt much out there that can compete with Jeep  While I unfortunately have not had the experience  it is well known that a vehicle does not recieve the Jeep brand unless it can successfully negotiate the Rubicon Trail  At least its nice to know that if you do require such a situation  that it can be done Once you become accustomed to this  and it doesn t take long  you will begin to realize how much all the other wonderful attributes of this vehicle overcome this minor shortcoming  The Jeep is not a truck based vehicle  like so many other SUV s are  such as the Ford Explorer  the GMC Jimmy  and the Durango  It therefore does not have a truck like ride  and is more smooth and quiet like a car  because it is unibody construction in lieu of body on frame  Unibody provides a more rigid  stable and quieter platform Fuel mileage figures which I have experienced ranged from a worst case of 12 5 mpg while towing a car through the eastern U S  mountains  to 21 mpg during a trip  Combination city   highway  for me at least  has been around 16 mpg  The Grand Cherokee  with this 5 2 litre V8  has lots of power  which is nice when merging onto the interstates I have had no mechanical problems with this vehicle whatsoever after 44 000 miles of driving  other that the fact that my front rotors were replaced under a recall notice  and I replaced all disc brake pads at that time as well  I also just replaced the spark plugs  and have changed fluids and filters oil  transmission  etc  as recommended by the maintenance schedule If you are looking for a sport utility vehicle  you cannot go wrong with a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited br br  
  65279 Ever since the Outback first came out it looked like a car I wanted  So last year when looking for a new car I started looking out at Outbacks  The new ones were beyond my budget and unfortunately used ones were scarce  Dealers kept telling me that people like them so much they just don 146t trade them in  I was starting to believe it when I finally found a used 1997 Legacy Outback Wagon  My only hesitation in buying it was the mileage  98 000 for a five year old car  A little higher than average  but after researching the matter I found the average life of one of these cars is 250 000 miles  That made me feel better about my purchase  that there was lots of mileage left in the car  So far I have been extremely happy with it  Some other reviewers complained about the lack of power and considered it a  147con 148 for this car  It is only a negative if you 146re looking for power  My opinion is that this car has plenty of power for a 4 cylinder  2 5 L engine  It accelerates easily and has no trouble on off road terrain  It has an adequate amount of power for the size and weight of the vehicle  it is not meant to be a sports car after all  The car has a five speed transmission  so your acceleration largely depends on your ability to shift gears  not on its power  It shifts very smoothly too  This car also has cruise control  something that wasn t available on a stick shift for a long time  This has come in handy on long road trips and of course improves gas mileage  And it is easy to learn to use unlike some other cruise control systems I have experienced I find it rather amusing too  that other reviewers complained about the lack of color choices with this car  They are probably correct about that I haven 146t seen very many  But what does color have to do with its performance  You might want a lighter color in a hotter climate to try to cut d own on heat inside and so that oxidation of the paint doesn 146t show as much  Other than that  I don 146t feel color is a  147con 148 By the way  mine is the two tone teal green and metallic brown The car gets fair gas mileage  At the time it was rated for about 28 mph highway 24 mph city  Depending on conditions  I find I can get higher mileage than that  One particular trip I got about 32 miles to the gallon  Keep your car tuned up and you should be able to do as well  The fifth gear acts as an overdrive gear and can help increase mileage when highway driving  Using air conditioning lessons the mileage somewhat We all look after our creature comforts  so the air conditioning and heating are important features  The air conditioning may be about the only complaint I have about this car  It just doesn 146t seem to get going as quickly as my Escort  And it isn 146t as cold  though it is adequate for cooling off on a hot day  If anyone is in the back seat  though  they won 146t be able to get as cool because you 146ll need more of the air flow in the front  The heating is another story  It is more than adequate and I actually find myself getting hot  The car also has rear defrost  which is a real time saver when I have to leave for work  I can just let it do its thing and the window will be clear before I actually have to look out the back  There is also a rear wiper blade  handy during the rainy season The interior is very roomy for this small size station wagon  There is plenty of room in the front seat passengers  The seats are adjustable for taller drivers and riders  The seat belt height can be adjusted for shorter drivers so that the shoulder belt is not coming across your neck  The seats recline quite far back in case the front seat passenger would like to nap while riding  Its beyond me why the driver 146s side seat has this same feature  I don 146t plan on napping while driving  As long as the front seats aren t pushed back too much to accommodate taller riders  there is plenty of room for the average height adults in back  There is plenty of width for three back seat passengers  There is a roof rack too  so you can attach car top carriers  bike racks  etc The rear of the car is a standard hatch  rather than a trunk  There is a storage area underneath the carpet area for the tire and some small tools  This car comes with a real tire as a spare  not one of those cheap  147donut 148 tires  There is a tray underneath  where you can store a flashlight  jumper cables  etc  for emergencies  There are also two small compartments on the side to stash other equipment in  The back has plenty of space of hauling groceries or all those Christmas presents you bought  Both rear seats fold down  so there is ample room to carry longer things  such as a stepladder The car does have air bags on both driver and passenger sides  This will give you a break on your insurance  Another safety feature is that the rear windows will only roll down halfway  This helps ensure that children or pets do not fall out  Another important safety feature is the ABS  anti lock brake system  This feature allows the wheels to keep turning when applying the brakes on slick surfaces  Otherwise the wheels would stop turning and send the car into a skid  I have had a chance to use the ABS this winter and I had no trouble with slipping as the car stopped me before I could slide at all  You do not pump the brakes like you would on a standard car  but just press them down and hold them  It 146s a very secure feeling to have this kind of system and it also gives me a break on my car insurance  The car is also all wheel drive  which is also a big help in snowy conditions  Rather than a 4 wheel drive  which gives the same amount of power to all wheels  the Outback system has the ability to redistribute power to the wheel that needs more power  It senses when there is slippage and gives more power one side and less on the other  This was also fantastic during this winter  As long as the snow isn 146t too deep to high center me  since the clearance isn 146t as high as an SUV  I feel like I can get through anything This car also has power locks and power windows  The driver 146s side has controls for all four windows  plus the locks  The passenger door has lock controls plus control for just that one window  Rear doors have window controls only  This model has an AM FM cassette player  but does not have a CD player  There is plenty of room to install one  though I haven 146t taken the time as I have adequate radio stations to choose from  It is about average quality for a factory installed model  with decent adjustments  seek and scan features  and rear speakers  It can 146t handle high volume  which is just fine for me since that bass gives me a headache anyway  It does have fog lights  which is good for me since we have more fog than we have snow  Another nice feature is that the headlights automatically shut off when you turn off the ignition  even if you have left the switch on  They ll automatically come back on too  when you turn the car on again  No more dead batteries There is one odd feature 150a button to turn on parking lights only  This seems to be a little dumb  since when you turn your headlights on  the first click is parking lights only  Now I didn 146t realize this button was there until I flipped it one time thinking it was the hazard lights  I was turning on the rear defrost  Or so I thought  I had actually flipped on the hazard lights  So trying to figure out how I turned on the hazards I turned on this parking light button  This is because all of these buttons are located in spaces I would not expect them to be 150the rear defrost button is not by the heating controls  but is on the dash by the speedometer  I pushed the button that IS by the heating controls  which is the hazard button  Who was expecting that  So I pushed the button on the steering column  which is typically where the hazard button is  Except that it was the parking light button  A kind of strange set up if you ask me I 146ll have to agree on the inconvenience of the cup holder  It sticks out of the middle of the dash  so when deployed the cupholder and the cups are in the way of adjusting your temperature controls  Though you can still adjust your radio  you can 146t see what you 146re doing  If you have your air on  the cups can also partially block air flow from your vents  Well  other than a couple of odd features in the car  I am overall very satisfied with it  It is comfortable to drive  it handles well on dry pavement and in snow  gets good mileage for its type  and has good safety features  I have had no major mechanical problems with it  Subarus also have an excellent rating for withstanding crashes  I think I will own this car for a long time  
 I bought a 2001 Corolla LE in August 2000 and have put on about 50 000 miles  I originally owned an  83 Tercel that taught me the virtues of a long lasting simple automobile  I drove cross country six times in the  Yoter  and only had to change a fuel pump and some warped rotors along the way   but those happened well after the car had 100 000 miles OK  back to the Corolla  After living in Baltimore for a couple of years  the exterior has an interesting assortment of dings  dents  and scratches  but the interior is pure gold  No problems with any mechanical or electrical system  everything works just like the day I bought it Fuel economy is excellent  and I m the type of person who calculates it religiously   I have a 5 speed and I usually average 38 39 mpg with mostly highway driving  If I do more in town driving  that might drop to about 36 mpg  Performance is fair to middling   acceleration is slow in first gear  second is better  and third has some muscle  The clutch is not too forgiving and takes some practice  and the hair trigger accelerator doesn t help matters much  I ve done some severe weather driving and the car is sure footed in snow and rain   front wheel drive and the manual transmission do the trick  Braking is OK but requires more force on the pedal than one might be used to  especially in an emergency situation  Handling is fairly tight but the car s cheap suspension and 14 inch wheels show up on bumpy terrain  Despite occasional discomfort the suspension appears to be hardy  having dealt with Baltimore s awful streets without any repairs to date  and a high speed impact with a rock on the highway didn t cause any damage beyond a tire Let s talk about size for a moment  I m 6 foot 5 inches tall  and I m at my limit in terms of interior space  and forget it for the person in the back seat behind me  But the weird thing is I ve sat in a lot of so called bigger cars and they re all worse  Even the new Cadillacs  One notable exception is the Volkswagen Golf  which has a great front seat and lots of legroom  The Corolla has pretty generous head room but the leg room is tight  I recommend cruise control so at least you can move around a little on longer trips Interior ergonomics are efficient and to the point  Controls and displays are easy to use and designed to last  The cruise control has a great feature where you can push the lever up to go 1 mph faster or down to go 1 mph slower  I also like the automatic headlights   you never have to worry about turning them on or off Good design extends to the engine compartment  All the fluids are very easy to check and refill if necessary  The air filter and lightbulbs are easy to change too  The engine itself is all aluminum and you don t see the usual copious amount of plastic  There s a generous space between the bumper and the engine  which would save lots of dough in a front end crash In this age of monster SUVs  the issue is going to be  is it too small  But let me point out the benefits   tight turning circle  getting into those parking spots nobody else can  and the ability to weave through city traffic  The Corolla has a big trunk  no problem packing up for a two week vacation  And on smooth roads you can pretend you re in a much bigger car  Another advantage of small is affordability   I paid 15 grand including taxes and tags  a pretty good deal considering how long I expect the car to last Based on my past experience with the Tercel  200 000 miles is a reasonable lifetime for the Corolla  and the repairs I expect to make are new brakes  300  and tires  350  around 75K miles  and again at 150K  and possibly a new alternator  300  starter  300  struts  300  and waterpump  300  around 100 150K miles  OK  maybe the fuel pump  200  at some point too  The exhaust systems and AC last forever on the Corolla  according to Consumer Reports surveys  The key is that these items are easy to identify when they break and don t rack up the bill for labor By the way  these prices assume that you never  never take your car to the dealer  which is the ultimate no no if you want to save money on car repairs  With the Corolla  you can gleefully ignore the recommended servicing  just have your local mechanic check things when you go in for an oil change  Look for that gas station repair shop with a guy named Chip  Mike  Steve  or Joe  that ll be your place The Corolla is a car for people that want to  or have to  drive in an urban suburban environment without worrying about things breaking  and save lots of money along the way  This is the car that will take a licking and keep on ticking  but it s still a big step up from my old no AC  AM radio Yoter  which I affectionately called  the lawnmower with wheels  
 The Volvo S80 is a solid luxury car that feels like a sports car but is a sound  safe family car  I love its handling  turning radius  and overall driving feel I considered other cars in my recent purchase decision  but they paled before the safety record and driving enjoyment I experience with the Volvo S80  I frankly decided to lease the car because I wanted it and loved its features  but couldn t afford to buy it outright I can t think of a thing that I hate about it  or even dislike  It is the perfect car for a family   big enough to hold three kids in the back seat without much friction Great car br br  
 We owned a 1992 Ford Aerostar  which we purchased used  Didn t realize until out shopping for a  quot possible quot  new car that they had discontinued making this model  After searching on the web and talking to friends that own Windstars  not to mention walking into a deal on one  we chose the Windstar  I was convinced that I was not going to like this vehicle  I loved my Aerostar  about a week after purchasing our Windstar  1998 model  I was indeed in love again  Our family is getting older and kids are getting ready to move out  I cannot honestly see myself driving any other type of vehicle  even when its just one child and us  Ours has traction control  which I ve never had before  but had to use one or two days after initial purchase  worked great on a solid sheet of ice If you have a young family this vehicle would be ideal  plenty of room for car seats  toys  etc  And plenty of room for the kids  quot not quot  to touch each other  Travel is made comfortable by the reclining middle seat  we have 2 bench seats instead of captain s chairs in this one  Plus with a luggage rack on top  mounting a car top carrier is very easy br br  
 I was recently in the market for a hatchback car  and researched the VW Golf and the Civic HB  I finally decided on the VW  which i am quite happy about  It s a cute car  but that isn t all there is to it  I chose a manual transmission which shifts smoothly and nicely  Pickup isn t as good as the Mazda 626  1996  that i had been driving before  especially with the AC on  but it is definitely still adequate  Trunk space is surprising for the size of the car however  it was hard to get a large bookcase into the car because the front seat does not fold down all the way  The size is great  especially for parallel parking  And i love how easy the hatchback makes backing up no guessing where the end of the car is  because you can see it  I haven t had the car long enough to comment on the overall dependability of it  though i do have plenty of friends who have VWs and all recommend getting them and claim that they will never buy another make of car  The air conditioner is the best i ve ever had in a car its cold within a minute of starting the car  and gets the car cool quick  Very nice when living in a hot humid climate like i do  I definitely recommend this car as a great one to buy br br  
 I bought a new ford ranger standard cab  2 1 2 years ago  I have taken a few long trips in this vehicle and have found for long trips it is a little uncomfortable  as far as dependability it has been a very dependable truck  I have not had any major problems with this truck other than just one small irritating problem  my inside light does not turn off after the door is shut  It gets very good gas mileage and rides well     
 I bought a 1999 F250 SUPER DUTY shortly after they were released in May of 1998  I am a farmer so I use this truck every day to tow heavy trailers  hauling cattle  equipment and so on  My truck is the XL series and it has the 7 3 Liter Powerstroke Diesel engine  It is equipped with a six speed manual transmission and Four Wheel Drive  The only mechanical defect that I have had on this truck was the parking brake lever broke in September of 1999  At that time  the truck had 63 000 miles on it It is reasonably good on fuel mileage with my 20 f t  stock trailer and 10 cows climbing mountains  I get around 11 13 MPG traveling with no trailer or load 17 20 MPG  At this time  the truck has over 70 000 miles on it it still starts and runs like new  I also find the truck to be very comfortable to drive  Talk about power  This is the first vehicle that I have owned that the cruise control works like it should  I would recommend this truck for anyone who has serious towing to do and wants to be the first one there  These trucks can tow  I would not buy the diesel engine with a automatic transmission for towing purposes  The automatic transmissions are weak  They just do not seem to have the towing ability as the manual transmission  The Super Duty Ford Trucks are not for some one who doesn t tow much  I recommend buying a lighter model that is much cheaper     
 Our   99 Taurus SE  automatic  with spoiler  would not get if have choice  Our second Taurus  first was a  98 SE which gave no problems whatever for about 100 000 km  62000 mi  The  99 was leased by a sales manager for his wife who wanted a van and would not drive the Taurus  we bought it March 2002 with 18000 km  11200 mi    looked brand new   along with extended warranty for  850 Cdn  as the 3 yr  warranty had expired  Same feeling as with the  98  i e  very good car for long trips and fuel efficient  However  at 25000 km  15500 mi  first Service Engine Soon  SES came on   cause  speed sensor in the transmission  not covered by ext  warr    surprise  surprise    Ford l after some haggling  paid half  On trip  about 1500 mi  from home 2nd SES  vacuum sensor on the Exhaust Gas Recirculator and running light module were replaced   484 Cdn   again not covered by ext  warr  but Ford again paid half  I am now wondering about the OBDII stuff on newer cars and what would happen if the SES light flashes  meaning shut off engine  a long way from any help  Still  I like the Taurus  it s useful  can get 8 ft  boards in the car  etc  I just wish Ford would continue making it  but just improve it  Would I it recommend anyone  family person  single  whatever  for sure  My email  ardate sympatico ca for anyone wanting to discuss the SES stuff and Taurus  further  One last thing  On some vehicles  the trunk hinges are somewhat toward the center  on the Taurus  these are on the sides   much  much better  
 When the time came to replace our 93 Mercury Villager  we d owned a minivan of some sort for over 10 years  We d always admired the sexy sport utes  but from a practical standpoint the minivan configuration always seemed to do a better job of meeting our needs  We need extra seating  not all the time but it has to be there if we want it  Most sport utes have no more seating than your basic 4 door sedan We need interior volume and headroom  In a minivan  if you have to you can get out of your seat and get back to the kids with reasonable ease  In the average sport ute you re going over the seat  A minivan is typically a little wider than a sport ute  which again tends to be more car like in its ergonomics  so they can seem a little cramped despite their high road stance Finally  we like the unibody construction of a minivan for a quiet  smoother ride than the ladder frame based sport utes deliver  Now the 2001 Montero comes along  Completely redesigned  the new Montero is a unibody vehicle  with all of the inherent benefits  So  despite it s rather large size and high stance  it drives like a minivan  A damn big minivan  for sure  but certainly not a truck You can look at the picture and see that it s a hell of a lot sexier than a minivan  so I won t go on about the exterior styling  which is probably the freshest treatment of the sport ute concept to date  Inside  you ll find a nice  wide interior with a nicely designed center console  Buckets up front and a 60 40 bench in the second row that folds and flips and does all kinds of things that you ll have to read the manual to understand  But the coupe de gras has to be the little 3rd seat set that pops up out of the floor in the cargo area  creating a total seating capacity of 7 The XLS gets a cloth treatment that s comfortable and looks sporty and functional rather than downscale  The LTD gets the leather and wood makeover and is downright plushy Our Mitsu dealer had a choice of two  count em  both XLS  both white with pewter cladding  Now they ve got one  But if they had the LTD I d probably have sprung for the extra 3k  Ours stickered for  31 800  We passed on the  1000 sunroof option and chose to have an aftermarket LCD video screen and VCR installed instead   The sunroof and it s mechanicals takes away the prime screen mounting location above and between the front seats If you re dreading that next minivan purchase and would rather drop the money into something a little more fun  drag your wife down to the Mitsubishi store and drive the new full size Montero Update 1 month Yikes  get ready for a reality check at the insurance agent  This beast was double what the minivan was to insure  I didn t even think to check before I bought it  Also  the thing gulps gas  Otherwise  still a nice machine  just budget for the extra ownership expense We got to use that little 3rd seat  Little s the word  Two six year olds were cramped in there  and access is very awkward through the rear gate The  quot check engine quot  light came on because the gas cap wasn t fully secure  something to do with air flow  It was no big deal to reset  except the dealer would only do it by appointment and it took an hour br br  
 When this car first came out  I was attracted by its beautiful lines and attractive features  I test drove it with a V6 engine and was sold  The handling is silky smooth and just melts into those tricky corners and though the V6 is not as smooth as the Japanese Imports in its class  it gives out a roar to let all know that this baby s got North American power to leave the pretenders behind in the dust   Only the Beamers  Benz and Audis have whipped my butt so far  If you re thinking of a Honda or Toyota or Nissan or some import  check out the Alero  It s definitely sexier than most in its class  the V6 has got bite  and lots of value for the buck     
 The 89 Nissan Sentra has been a very good car for me  While this car is more than 10 years old  manufactured in 1988  it has required very little maintenance This car was purchased for me in 1997  since then  the only repair expenses  besides normal maintenance  have come because the bright light apparatus had worn out and because of an inexpensive oil leak This car gets great gas mileage  between 30 35 mpg hwy  and has enough power to make you feel like you re driving a newer  more sporty vehicle  Also  it is small enough to easily maneuver any parking lot or crowded street  without driving like most low powered compact cars  I would recommend this car  as an inexpensive  efficient  economical car br br  
 Let s see  where to start My wife had to have this car   Honey it s sooooo cute  I was against getting it  but it was the only car that she test drove that she liked  I realize  only too late  that this was a mistake We paid 10K for it in 1997 1998 and it had 15K on the odometer  The body and paint were o k  and it didn t seem like too bad a car  At 65000 miles  the timing belt broke and we had to install a new engine  Of course  a new engine ran around  2300 and so we had to settle for a used engine  The used engine runs much better than the original engine  but it is much noisier  Her car sounds like a Panzer Tank when she pulls it into the carport  This is not because of an exhaust leak  it is just very noisy The paint has begun to flake off on both sides of the car s door moulding  The rest of the paint looks terrible  This  considering the vehicle has been parked in a carport all the time  makes me wonder where Hyundai bought their paint and the skill with which it was applied  At 75000 miles  the a c  stopped working  According to the shop  the a c  evaporator is shot and must be replaced  500 00 to start with to repair it  This on a vehicle that blue books at 1200  I don t think so The interior is very cheesy  The dash and console are made of thin plastic that cracks easily  Not that ramming my fist into it several times helped the situation  I must admit  The seat covers feel like they were woven from rope and are very abrasive  Keep this in mind when riding in shorts Ouch I had to replace the exhaust system from the engine back since it rusted out  Of course  the aftermarket system didn t fit like it should and now it rattles and bangs as it hits the frame  Nice The clutch is soft and the transmission won t go into reverse unless you creep the car a bit forward first This car drives terribly on snow and ice  even with studded tires  My wife and I were on the way to the hospital to have our first baby when I found this out  Like I wasn t a nervous wreck to start with  It won t drive up on ramps to let me change the oil  because it rides so low  so I have to use a floor jack  The trunk space is decent  but I m afraid to haul much back there since the body dents so easily The factory stereo is a joke  My wife had it replaced with a cd player  but the radio installer almost had a nervous breakdown trying to figure out the wiring schematic  In short  I hate this car  
 The Acura NSX is  the  best sports car offered  and probably ever made  IMHO  I will explain below  And you know  before I begin  let me say that this is a very significant statement to make  and I would never ever hesitate to say it again and again  including the times I have in the past  if it wasn t for one car  The Ferrari F355  see my review for this  but just as a quick note  The best looking  best sounding  closest to feel to an F1 car ever  However  this car is SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive than the NSX  especially when you are smart enough to realize you can walk into an Acura dealership and easily demand for a decent discount on the  84 000 starting MSRP for the NSX The one I tried was a  98  and it was the coupe  But you can get the Targa which you can easily store the removable top off of and store over the rear window  it s supposed to be a very simple operation  and it s very light  For  97  they introduced the 290HP 3 2L  prior to this it was 3 0L 270HP  and the 6spd  prev  5 spd  Also the chassis got better  and so did the brakes  For the Y2k  you got perforated leather  and maybe a new color I think Why do I say this is the best sports car ever  It s quite simple  if I had to sum it up in one sentence  By far and away  this is the easiest exotic to drive comfortably like a pro  which makes you look and feel like a hero behind the wheel  and that makes all the difference in the world  Let s go back a little  The usual things to talk about  Styling  I can t believe how some people don t like it  Talk about a successful design  It looks like a machine  quot ready for war quot  or something  Futuristic  threatening  oozing in quality  Exterior fit and finish  As good if not better than the 911 or Ferrari  The car comes with  quot just quot  17 inch wheels  which are undoubtedly made of a lightweight aluminum compound  Previously  the NSX had been plagued with rear tires that were forced to have very small lifespans  I guess this was due to the compund desired by the Yokohamas  and the factory camber setting  But I believ as of  97 this issue had been addressed  The chassis itself it all aluminum  sharing this exclusivity with the Audi A8  You can own this car for 50 years and it won t rust  How cool is that    A couple of friends of mine tell me it sure looks  quot hot quot  but they don t like how far much distance there is between the rear windshield and the taillights  I  quot kinda quot  see their point  but I say it really doesn t look BAD in any way  plus you have to remember they obviously and carefully thought out the balance issue  with this being a mid engined car et all Now for the interior  Ok  tell me of a sports car with a better interior than this  Looks incredible  pretty much due to two features  That COOL slanted center console design  and those seats  The most beautiful  and comfy seats  BY FAR in any sports car I have ever tried  Don t tell me Recaro seats in this and that  These are the BEST  And the engineers know it  It has just 4way power  back front  and tilt  2 ways  That s it  That s all that s needed  magically  whether you re 6 3 like me or 5 3  ok  ok  not sure about being that height  but I would bet on it  The seats look especially gorgeous in that tan color  Wow  Ok  about the spaciousness  excelent in every category except headroom  I was REAL close to touching the roof with my hair all the time  but hey  I guess I can always live somewhere sunny and get the NSX T  targa  The panoramic view  typical of pretty much all Hondas Acuras  is perhaps best appreciated in the NSX  You literally feel you re driving  THIS  close to the ground  Also this is a great controllability  and naturally  safety   quot feature quot  being able to look through this much glass  ever driven a Camaro for example  You feel like you re sitting in a bathtub  Yuck  In the USA  the standard BOSE system is not fantastic  but damn good  The gauges are HUGE and can be read by even your half blind 100 year old acquiantances  heheh  The steering wheel and shifter  more on this later  fall right into place and feel perfect  Oh  did I mention those awesome seats  I think so  So to sum  by far and away the most comfortable cockpit of any sports car  and perhaps the most pleasing to the eye  ok  fine  the F355  456GT  and Maranello are nothing to complain about  if you know what I mean  Gorgeous ain t the word people  but the NSX s interior is so special and well thought out  I gotta give it the edge  Check it out for yourselves  Especially while in motion Driving  Ok  here is where it all truly matters  I don t know where to start  This car is dead quiet at idle  but boy  slam on the gas pedal and your are rewarded with a glorious sound  perhaps second only to those aural sensation offered by that famous Italian manufacturer  no  not Lamborghini  the Diablo sounds awesome  but the NSX is better for me  See  the thing is  NOTHING will ever beat the Ferrari F355 s engine note  nevermind how amazing it sounds  but it changes in frequency and note for virtually every 500RPM rise  The NSX s engine sound is not as dynamic  and perhaps a little less enthusiastic  but boy does it provide a rush and a half  F355 provides a rush and a half and a quarter  but anyway Ok  Enuf engine sound  It is fabulous  making you think you re in a race car  like F1  ok  Oh  gotta mention one more thing  It difficult to hear the engine of the NSX if you re not sitting in the car  unlike the F355  which by the way  sounds twice as good from OUTSIDE the car than from the inside  yup yup  unless the driver of the Acura is hauling derriere  but from the inside it ROCKS ROCKS ROCKS  Email me if you wanna have me mail you a sound sample of two  I have a couple of movies but they are too big to email to most servers  Ok  one more thing  911s  at least the 993 incarnation  which is perhaps the best ever  sound incredible too  that air cooled raspiness  but I am sorry  no  actually happy  to say that they don t sound as truly splendid and mesmerising as the NSX This engine revs to 8000RPM easy  and actually develops max power at 7100RPM  290 horses  to be exact  You think that isn t enough  224 lb ft of torque  A weenie  Really  Well how about 0 60 times that are consistently below the 5 0 sec range  How about close to 4 5 secs actually  1 4 mile runs in the low 13s  easy  The car isn t that light either  like 3000 lbs or 3100 3150 with the Targa top  actually an NSX T recently tested by C amp D hit 4 5 secs 0 60 twice in a row  Not only that  the NSX can smoke a Corvetter  345HP  at over 130mph  due to gearing ratio advantages  What do you want me to say   THIS  is what I call engineering efficiency and know how  Ok look  I will face it  If I had the money for the NSX  an extra  10k for the Comptech supercharger kit  extra 100HP I think  wouldn t be an issue  Unless it changes the engine exhaust sound significantly  Geez  with that you can run with the true big boys all the time  3 2L V6 eh   THIS  is the best 6 cylinder in the world  but far  Yes  it is expensive  what with hand building assigned to a single engineer  ala Merecedes V 12s  not sure about the brand new 5 7L ones  and Diablos  and titanium connecting rods  Still  the best one  period  Yes people say why don t they throw in a V8 or V12  it is very expensive anyway  but the whole point is being missed  Less weight   better  quot SPORTS quot  car  Period  Why do you think the S2000 has a 2 0L 4 cylinder to produce 240HP through normal aspiration  The philosophy makes sense  and at least in this car  it shows Launching this bad boy was very easy  Gee  I wonder if that has anything to do with THE BEST SHIFTER CLUTCH COMBO EVER  I have always applauded Honda Acura s efforts in this dept  in all their manual tranny equipped cars  but the NSX s 6 spd  I mean  to say it s a joy to use  is like saying the Victoria Secret model Mrs  Casta is beautiful  Has Acura reached perfection with their shifter  The clutch is perfect too  Pretty much  I mean  what more can you ask for  Yeah  perhaps an option of the F1 tranny like in the F355  but boy  if you like to row your own gears  this is the best car to do it in  PRECISION  QUALITY  NEAR PERFECTION I got this car up to about 130 or so  but I constantly read that the car is utterly stable even at 160 170mph  And I believe it  That s not such a great thing actually  cuz the new Carrera and F355 feel  as  stable anyway  Hell  the F355 at redline in 5th  I was too busy listening to the  quot music quot  but I think that was like 270 or 280kph  or 170mph  I think  was completely stable  Handling  Ok  take a wild guess  Look  for everything I ve mentioned so far  and everything I will under this sentence  do me a favor  and go the site  http www nsxbyacura com There is a wealth of info about most of the design issues concerning the NSX  and they are worth looking over  there is multimedia content too  to learn about how special the suspension engine brakes etc  is  This review is already too long so I won t digress Back to handling  This car is so comfy  again  it s really a luxury car when not pushed and a true sports car when it is  Quiet  controlled  and professional at everything it does  the suspension is somehow supple enough to make some bumps and holes seem like they are not there  well  the F355 is as good at this too  but that makes complete sense  Both companies learn a HECK of a lot from racing  and they offer this secret knowledge to the public in select production vehicles  like these 2  When pushed around  this car understeers quite a bit  but that is a good thing for most of us  cuz it s safer than oversteer  However  Keep in mind  It s a RWD mid engined car  There is not as much intertia at the front end and back end as you might think  By the nature of its design  it s pretty much all in the middle  What does this mean  Be careful in either applying the brakes too hard in the middle of a turn  letting off the brakes real fast  or lifting off the gas too abruptly  If you do  well  the limits are really high  but you will spin indefintely  However  this car has razor sharp reflexes and steering  check this out  It s powered by an electric motor  not the conventional belt  as to save on engine load a couple of horsepower  Again  an example of powerplant efficiency  The steering is awesome in feel  Mid engined cars feel as sensitive in cornering as darts when thrown through the air  With a proper suspension  chassis  and steering  ala NSX F355  it is sublime Chassis rigidity is exemplary  certainly owing to the manufacturing process  And it sure helps the suspension do its thing s  The car feels just so solid  and obviously the car would be much lighter if it not were for that detail  With such a compact engine  drivetrain  and being all aluminum  chassis suspension  most of the brake system  the car would be a lot less than 3000lbs but the designers wanted this car to have this exemplary stiffness  and it shows  Somehow  some way  it weighs more than it should  but that s a good thing  cuz wow the thing feels solid  However  compare this to the F355 this car is as light if not like 100 lbs  less  and it s not all aluminum  and I guess the engine is at least on the order of 50 75lbs heavier  So what gives  Hey  Ferrari is Ferrari  and the car DOES cost  50k extra  Maybe hardcore drivers won t like the stock suspension as when pushed 9 10ths or 10 10ths the car does exhibit some nose dive rise  but hey  this is physics  You want a great comfy ride in the city at less than full boil  Here you go  and this is the consequence  but I ll be damned if it s a problem  because the control is awsome  and The brakes are TERRIFIC  Just ask those people who autocross with NSXs  They consistently spank Vipers  Porches  you name it  because the car is so confidence inspiring with its visibility  brakes  and handling  They make up for the straightaways at the turns  hey you are going with 400 hp cars here  let s not forget  in the bends  Also  I don t know if we should call this  quot exotic quot  Because it s as comfy as your neighbor s Honda Accord  and as reliable to boot  Not only that  it s got literally DOUBLE the gas mileage of its rivals  Ok  the Porsche 911 is pretty good too  but talk about EXOTICS  and you know what I mean  I think the EPA rating is 18 24  Wow  Then you have the exotic speed  style  grace  stability  ability  The fabulous engine sound  the brakes  All superlatives  Well  there are a couple of  quot bad quot  things I guess I would owe it to you to mention in such a comprehensive review  One is that I kinda don t like how the pop up headlights look when they are up from certain angles  But then again I almost think that with the F355  which is the most beautiful car in the world  I guess the redesign  whenever that is  will address that with fixed headlights  But boy  does the hood look awesome when they are down  Oh  sorry  back to the  quot bad quot  stuff  The other thing I could think of is well  storage space  Yeah yeah I know it s not fair to expect much  but I am TELLING you that this car can EASILY be your daily driver  and thus you want semi decent trunk space  and interior storage bins  which are kinda lacking  Err  I think it has a sunglassess holder  I can t remember for sure  Also  while the car does have ABS and Traction Control  it would be nice to have something like BMW s DSC system to keep your under oversteering in check  at any speed  Actually Acura DOES have this for its Acura RL  called VSC  Vehicle Stability Control  so why not incorporate it for the NSX  Oh  unnecessary weight  That s right   So  the last thing  Price  Too much  Why  cuz it s a  quot Honda quot  or  quot Acura quot  And  The technology and the ability of this car spanks on your fave sports cars in many ways  so what is your point  Not enough advertised HP  Heheh  then why is it as fast  literally  as cars from Europe with significantly more power  And you won t be spending 1 2 the gas money driving this baby 365 days a year as your neighbor in his V8 Expedition or GMC truck  Nevermind the other neighbor with the F355 or Porsche Turbo   I say it s a DAMN STEAL  and I wish I could buy one today  as I am afraid the redesign won t be as amazing  witness 360 Modena  uhm  no thanks  I ll be on the lookout for the suddenly in collectable status F355  Alas  for some reason  this car is  CRIMINALLY  ignored by the rich  here and in other markets around the world  Actually  I think I know the reason  People like to show off too much  and it would be cooler to be in a 911 than a  quot Honda quot  Ok  911s are absolutely amazing  but the NSX is beyong special  Ahh  you know what  Ferrari is REALLY lucky with its F355  It has been so successful that they postponed the introduction of its successor by two years  If that wasn t the case  I bet the NSX would have been considered by many more  I just know that if most of you just try the car out you will realize how much this praise I give the car is really worth it  Bravo Honda  to me this is a lot more than your  quot Image quot  car br br  
 I had a few pickup trucks  years ago  but somehow found myself driving an imported compact sedan for the past five years  This year  I decided to trade that vehicle in and get back into a small truck  I read countless reviews online  many right here  before making up my mind  And the day I test drove my little Ranger XL it was love at first sight A  plain Jane  work truck  my Ranger reminded me of my first car  a Chevy police car  with its tough  vinyl seats and heavy duty rubber floor mats  The dash and seats looked surprisingly good for a truck with 60 000 miles and nothing rattled or squeaked Since I had set a price range of  6 7 000 for myself  I knew I wasn t going to get a fully loaded XLT with CD player  extended cab and 4 wheel drive  This truck was just what I wanted  At  6 000 from a dealer  I could get a good  solid truck and pay a few bucks for a warranty With the 2 3 liter engine  2 plugs per cylinder and a high flow exhaust header from the factory  I didn t expect much  But thanks to the hot gears  3 73  and well tuned transmission gear range  this truck moves out pretty well  certainly better than my old Geo Prizm sedan  which supposedly had only 18 horsepower less than my truck  The 4 speed automatic works very well and the overdrive on off feature is great  The truck sounds good too  not loud but with a lot more personality than most 4 cylinder powered rides The stereo is a simple factory AM FM but it sounds terrific  four speakers  great reception  bass  treble  fade and balance controls and 18 presets  good enough for me Of course a compact truck without an extended cab is not going to provide a lot of interior space for passengers and stuff  But if you are alone  or riding with one passenger  all you need is a good storage box in the bed to take care of tools and some luggage  I got a nice box for  80 and put it in myself  I am 6 1  220 pounds and I am comfortable in this truck The Ranger rides very well in my opinion  I love the firm  truckish handling and so far  no one has complained that it s too bumpy I can t speak too much about the long term reliability since I haven t owned it that long  But I have high hopes  I have driven and owned compact Chevy trucks and an old Dodge import truck  Ram 50  and let me tell you  they felt like rattling junk compared to the solid nature of this machine  You feel it in the ride  in the seats  even in things like the transmission shifter and wiper control knobs  everything in this truck says  truck  even though it s a compact  So far  so good  
 We bought our Saturn SC2 when we could no longer afford the Ford Probe my husband had   Please see my review of the Ford Probe  My husband and I were still dating at the time  so this was a replacement car for him  He still wanted a sporty car  but a reliable one  My sister and her husband had a Saturn SL and had used it hard  and it was still in great condition  Except for one nasty comment  we d only heard good things about Saturns Since the only sporty option was the SC and my husband wanted as much engine as he could get  we went for the SC2  We also looked at other models  the Acura Integra used  the new Hyundai Tiburon  and the Mitsubishi Eclipse  For the money  the Saturn SC2 looked like the best buy  We test drove the Acura  but we really wanted new  We also test drove the Tiburon  but it was a horrible drive and incredibly uncomfortable  With such limited options  we decided on the SC2 It was very nice to not have to haggle  All we did was decide what we wanted  and it was a done deal  We did purchase their car care plan  which is a very reasonable cost  That made coming up with the money for regular maintainence a non issue  Getting scheduled for maintainence was pretty easy  and their waiting area was comfortable Other than scheduled maintainence  there was no other trips to the service center  We did have one problem with the tape deck  When it was cold out and the car had not been driven over night  the tape player would pop the tape out  This was annoying  We asked for repairs and it could not be fixed  We even had two new tape decks put in with no results  That was the only problem We loved our car  We drove it several places and it was quite comfortable for the 6 hour trip from Tucson to the Grand Canyon and also moving from Tucson to Omaha  Nebraska  The only reason we got rid of it was because the car seat we purchased for our baby did not fit in the back seat  In fact  even the small infant carrier car seats did not fit well in the back  Getting in and out of the car when pregnant was also no fun deal  This is a car for singles and couples with no children and no plans for children any time soon  If you do have small children  you need a second car for the proper safety seats to fit in  I imagine a 4 10 year old would sit comfortably in the back seat with no problems  I recommend the Saturn to anybody looking for a car  I don t know much about the other models of Saturn  but the SC2 is a good car br br  
 Having owned most of the competition  Chevy Blazer  GMC Jimmy  Olds Bravada etc  I found the Ford Explorer to be the most dependable  Mileage was equal to or better than the rest of the same size S U V s Definitely purchase the four wheel drive model  While going in you will pay more but the 4x4 will hold its value when it is time to trade in or resell Additionally  once you own a four wheel drive vehicle you will find the new desire to  quot explore quot  Interior space  Olds Bravada and Ford Explorer have the most  Chevy and GMC have the least  Durability  Ford definitely outlasted the others  Olds came in a near second Really a versatile mode of transport  ideal for city  country single or family     
 I am not going to make this long as there are already so many other opinions just sum up the good and the bad quick  Ok  we have been married for 6 1 2 years  Have a 2 year old  We first had a Saturn Wagon 1999  Talk about little when your coming from a Ford Ranger  Yuck  Anyway  got the van used  Had been a program car  rental for Avis found the sticker  Very clean and not worn anywhere  My only complaint is that it has the smokers package and you just know people smoked in it when it was a rental  I have quit for 3 years and don t want that in my car  It is hard enough as it is I love the entire car all auto everything including cruise  Paint is silver  doesn t show scratches and the windows are factory tinted  Very nice on a South Carolina summer day  Seats are really comfy  even on a long drive  The integrated child seats are the best thing ever  I just pop my son in and pop him out and don t fuss with the seat belts holding in the seat tight  I just pull up on the strap and it all tightens nicely but not too much  The pads in the seat can be chucked into the wash for easy cleaning  My son just loves the seats  Feels like a Big Boy now  Out of the car seat  I think he is safer as well  The lift out seats are great for changing the functions of the van  Not too mention vacuming the entire van quickly  The only thing I can think of that s  bad   but not a complaint would be that I don t know if it is hot in the back of the van or freezing for my passengers  They have to tell me first  I also keep a spare snow brush in the van for when my son decided to throw his rice cake at the door and it busts into a million crumbs  I can sweep it all out the door instead of dragging out the vacume every time  Oh  they didn t give us a full tank of gas at the dealer though  Thought that stunk  Kinda cheapy  I know it was used but sheesh  I even filled out their questionaire and told them  They just sent me another questionaire  
 I bought my 93 Tbird five years ago  It had around 25 000 miles on it and now it has about 73 000 miles  I have really enjoyed owning this car  It has been very reliable and the repairs have been mostly minor  I have replaced the alternator and fuel pump about a year ago  I actually damaged the fuel pump by putting too much fuel system cleaner in the gas tank  I have replaced the lower front tie rods and bushings and recently I found out that I need to replace the water pump and thermostat  I ve also had to fix a leak in the air conditioning system  this was the most expensive repair that I ve done  It might sound like a lot of repair  but spread out over five years it wasn t very much and the repairs were pretty minor The amazing thing is that the car drives like a new car  It handles great and it still looks good because of it s sporty styling  This car has the JBL Premium Sound System that includes a cassette tape deck and a cd player  There are six speakers in the car and a subwoofer that s mounted under the rear deck  The sound is really beautiful  The car also has a very large trunk  The interior is very roomy  especially the front seats  The rear seats can be a little cramped when the front seats are pushed back There are some flaws with this car  The head lights are plastic instead of glass and they turn cloudy and yellow in a couple of years  They really make the front of the car look bad and they reduce visibility at night  The interior trim work is not too good either  The headliner gets sun rotted near the rear window and the cloth speaker grills get stained easily  These are prettty minor things but this car is so nice that I like to keep everything about it in tip top condition Gas milage is about average for a car this size  21 25 mpg I would definitely buy this car again but I would find one with the v8 engine instead of the v6  The v6 is fine on level ground  but it strains when climbing even semi steep hills especially if there s two or three passengers in the car I think this is a very good car that requires less than average amount of maintenace and repair  
 I HAVE EDITED THIS DUE TO A VERY MAJOR EXPENSE  ENGINE FAILURE  ON JANUARY 29  2000  PLEASE READ THE BOTTOM FOR NEW AND VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION From the time we picked up our 1995 Windstar  we loved the ride  But  as many new vehicles are prone to  this one was in the shop for tweaking a few times This was probably an omen of things to come  as we have had the brakes replaced at low mileage  and under warranty  because Ford claimed that they did not have the proper brakes to install in the first place when the vehicle was new  I still don t understand that one Also  the  quot Check Engine Light quot  is constantly on  We have had it checked out several times when the vehicle was under warranty and they have not been able to find any cause for it  nor could they fix it After the warranty expired  we needed to have the Windstar serviced again because of an antifreeze leak  this turned out to be a recall notice item  but still cost us plenty  The nearly  1 000 in repair bills was due to the structure of the engine which needed to be somewhat dismantled so that the mechanics could work on the problem  labor costs  Oh  they said that we could take the chance and not get the repair work done since it was so costly  but knowing that we could have major problems if we didn t fix it  what else could we do but shell out the money to Ford MY HUSBAND TOOK THE WINDSTAR IN BECAUSE OF STRANGE SOUNDS IN THE ENGINE AREA  2 WEEKS AGO  AND WAS TOLD THAT  AT 79 000 MILES  THE ENGINE NEEDED REPLACING  THIS WILL COST US  3 000  DOLLARS  THE EXTENDED 3 YEAR WARRANTY ON THIS WORK WILL COST ANOTHER  1 634 00  WHEN THE DEALER WAS CALLED YESTERDAY TO CHECK ON THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK ON THE REBUILT ENGINE  WE WERE TOLD THAT THE LIFTERS ARE BAD  TOO  THIS WILL ADD ANOTHER  200 00 TO THE COST  You bet Ford will get a letter on this one AND THEN SOME I thank goodness for the communication possibilities of the internet because I did a search on  quot Ford Windstar Recall Notice quot  and was alarmed to find that thousands of people who have purchased the 1995 Ford Windstar are having similarly costly expenses and all seem to be pretty much the same in the nature of the repair work  Although it is comforting   to know that we are among a large group of people having the same wallet draining experience  I believe that it is time for the rest of the  quot silent majority quot  to speak up  If enough of us get to the point of saying  quot I m not going to put up with the way we re treated by the Ford Motor Company quot  we should be able to force Ford to put out a recall on the engine so that they must pay for the trash we are stuck with One last note before I end this ranting  through my research of dissatisfied customers on the internet  I learned that the recall notice on the head gasket problem was apparently not received by everyone  If you have not received this important notice  be sure to contact Ford  for whatever good that will do br br  
 In 1992 I bought my daughter a new Ford Explorer with a promise from her that I drive it until she started college a year later  When she started to college she took the Explorer with her and I drove another car  She drove the Explorer until 1999 when she purchased a 1999 Ford Mustang  I sold the car I was driving at the time and took back the Explorer  So you can see why I entitled this  quot Recycled Explorer quot We had problems with vibrations from the beginning  which I understand was a problem with most 1992 Explorers  The dealer from which I bought the car tried to correct this problem by installing shims  That didn t work and I ve been told that they should not have done this  This is the only major complaint we ve had with the car  Obviously  it was not so big a deal that we sold the vehicle  It now has 103 000 miles on and still going strong  We have had to replace the anti lock brake system and I recently had the rotors replaced  but the rotors are a part of wear and tear that you would normally expect br br  
 I have been driving a 2000 BMW 323i 4 Door Sedan since June first of 1999  and have enjoyed it immensely  For an entry price of under  30 000  one can purchase a 4 door sedan that has compact external dimensions and handles like a sports car  and still has 4 doors and room for 4 people and their belongings Like all BMW products  the steering provides tremendous feedback and excellent transient response  especially noticeable in the slalom course  and is quite neutral  Not only is the car light at 3 153 lbs  but with a weight distribution of 51 49  Front Rear  the car will ultimately understeer as it approaches its very high cornering limit The 2 5 liter inline six cylinder engine is extremely smooth and quiet  and produces a respectable 170 horsepower and 181 ft lbs of torque  0 60 is quoted at 7 1 seconds with the test cars  manual transmission  and top speed  observed  is 128 mph  The 5 speed manual transmission is silky smooth with a very light clutch This type of performance is not inexpensive  and the base list price is  27 560  As tested  with the Premium Package  Leather Interior  Heated Seats and In Dash CD Player  the car came to a list price of  33 680  While this is certainly not inexpensive  it certainly is reasonable in view of the performance level provided by the 323 br br  
 The Ford Escort ZX2 Sport is one of the best cars that Ford has put out in a long time  Who new that an Escort  I mean  look at the  83 models  could even be considered  quot sporty quot It has everything you can ask for  great sound system  the bass is wonderful  I play my music at full volume and have never blown a speaker  the back seats fold down to make more room in the trunk  looks awesome  great gas mileage  32 35 gallon  enough room for almost 6 people  I could go on and on  Maybe it s just WA state  but the other nice thing is that insurance is fairly low on the ZX2 because it s not considered a sports car  But this car just RIPS down the road  no  I wouldn t know that So if you re looking around at cars  get a ZX2  They re affordable  too  around the  12 000 16 000 price range  Can t beat that br br  
 This truck is unstoppable  my brother bought it in Calgary about 6 years ago and since then it has been across Canada 3 times and has had some hard rural driving the rest of the time  This truck was treated like a truck  it has hauled everything and has been everywhere and it shows no signs of letting up anytime soon  It s got the 4 0 liter engine  5 speed manual transmission  6 speaker sound system  and that s it for the options  spash decal on the side  tinted windows  sliding rear window  short box  alunimum rims  and is a metallic green in color  This truck was very sharp in it s day but wear and tear has taken a toll on the look of the truck  The 4 0 engine and the small size of the truck gives it lots of pep  You can catch 3 gears with the man transmission and it can stay with Mustangs and Camaros in races  I ve taken care of a few Civics with it myself  It s hard to keep back tires on it with so much pep  you want to spin em on every turn  I ve put 40 000 kms on this truck myself and with minimal work  I ve put a ball joint on and replaced a thermostat  also the exhaust had to be replaced  I would definatly recommend this truck and if I could find another one just like it in new condition and low kms I would buy it in a second  
 I have to admit  I have always been a Mustang guy  I like the way they look  the way they drive etc  But  that said the six cylinder mustang does not excite me for the price  I took a test drive in a pitch black 2003 SVT ZX5 Focus and could not wipe the grin off my face before the dealer saw it  It had a three thousand dollar rebate and a six disc in dash changer  It also is the exceptionally fun to drive  I am a motorcycle enthusiast and the SVT Focus on a curvy road revving the inline four with the supple six speed is a unique experience  Cautionary signs that say 30 mph turn are instantly turned into 60 mph turns with the steering  braking and transmission  On the downside  anything more than the most conservative shift patterns steal gas like there is a hole in the tank  But for the hour after work  where I find the curviest road out there  it is worth it  The 170 hp inline four pumps out good power  It isn t a straight line burner  but in the twisties with the proper use of the six speed transmission  there are very few cars under  40 000 that will keep up with it About the interior  I like it  My wife owns a 2002 VW Beetle and I wish Ford had done something a little niftier with the nighttime gauges and such but I think the build quality is solid and the seats are comfortable  I have the optional cold weather package and if you have never experienced heated seats in the dead of winter  I hope you will soon  This car  with the exception of the gas mileage is the closest thing to the kind of fun you experience on a motorcycle  while having trunk room and rear folding seats  
 We have bought this car in Feb  2001 and kept for 9 months Because the car was really cheap  the car has been working satisfactorily  But the car requires maintenance every months causing minor problems here and there The car has 91 000 miles and we had to fix so far as follows the cost of labor includes  starter 227  front end   alternator 241  a hole in radiator 86    new radiator 125  a c not fixed yet    door lining tipping don t bother fixing them  This car has been teaching us how to maintain the car because it breaks down very often  
 Please know I am not a Ford fan  however  I am a regular renter from Hertz   thus I drive LOTS of Fords  In the past two years  my favorite car to rent is a ford contour  This is a smaller version of a Taurus and it seems to have all the luxury features of a Taurus  except the wheel base and interior is slightly smaller It is excellent on mileage and seems to get around 23 25 mpg  The space for the driver is as good as the Taurus  The ones I have rented have all power seats and windows  so they all seem the same But  the space in the trunk far outweighs many other rentals I have had  IT handles very well and seems to have a pretty tight steering configuration  I find them almost fun to drive There is a good ability to see throughout the entire vehicle and there appears to be no blind spots  Also  there are the usual methods of safety built in   such as putting your foot on the break before you can release the shift out of park into another gear The arm rest is better than that awful Taurus nonsense of picking the entire deal up and pulling out this huge drink holder that is the armrest upside down The backseat did not look terribly big in terms of leg room  but then  how often do we have adults in our cars these days These are good solidly built cars  I feel very safe in this vehicle  for some reason that I cannot put to words  I feel like this car may even be safer than the Taurus  which I had a very serious accident in  in 1995 and the airbags saved my life and my ability to walk Perhaps  because it is so contoured to your body and the design on the interior is excellent  The seats are comfortable and you can ride in one of these for a long period without getting antsy or cramped up In all  if I were in the secondary market for a new car and saw one of these little babies on a lot  I would scoop it up in a heartbeat br br  
 When my boyfriend first suggested getting a Ford   DIESEL b  I was not pleased  My family has always had a Chevy GMC thing over Fords  I have heard stories about how horrible the gas mileage is that they get  how the paint fades  etc   We drove from PA to IL to get this truck and let me tell ya I was even more angry about the purchase to be because of the long ride  I hate to travel  My feelings changed when I rode in this brute of a truck  The truck rides very smoothly and it is very roomy  The 7 3 L Turbo Diesel engine gets very good gas mileage for a truck due to a chip my boyfriend bought after getting the Ford which makes it all the better  The interior is the beautiful Lariat Leather  The truck is fully loaded and has had no problems with any electrical stuff since we bought it six months ago  This is a very heavy duty nice vehicle for someone who wants a truck  and  a blazer p The only drawbacks that I have noticed is that in the  winter  it doesn t do so well in 2 Wheel Drive due to the heavy weight of the truck  Hills can be very hard to climb and it may not move very well in a foot of snow  Thanks to the trusty 4 Wheel Drive this really isn t a problem  It also requires about ten bucks more than other trucks to change the oil due to being a diesel   One experience to share is that my boyfriend let a friend borrow it  once  and he had it in a ditch  The ditch was very  very deep and it climbed right out of it  What we learned from that was the truck is very powerful and to never let a  friend  borrow something expensive    
 I would have to agree that the ownership of the Ford Taurus was not much fun  I had one for a few years and rarely drove it  Yes  it was a comfortable car  but it had so much problems  I ll tell you what kinds of headaches this car has caused  Until it s ultimate death at just a little over 100 000 miles  I ve had the front brake rotors replaced twice  an engine that overheated 3 times  electrical shortages  a whining and moaning steering rack  and the unbelievable  the subframe on which the engine is assembled fell to the ground  Of all the monstrosities of owning an unreliable vehicle  as my brother was driving it one day  he noticed that the steering locked while in motion  He hit a pothole and discovered that the engine suddenly fell on to ground  I ve never heard of such a thing  It really did happen  Being already out of warranty  we went to a local Ford dealer to see if this is normal  It turns out there was a recall on the subframe connectors or mounts  They fixed it for free  minus a  quot Metallica quot  CD one of the mechanics decides to steal from the back seat  I couldn t prove it  After a while  the Taurus developed this engine surge at all rests  either at a light or stop sign with the brake pedal applied  It was unexplainable to a mechanic  so we tried to live with it  Eventually  the surges would increase in intensity and eventually stall the motor  It s eventual demise came when I took a road trip to Florida from NY  On my way back to NY  it decided to finally die  The transmission blew at 105 000 in the middle of Virginia  In the meantime  my brother and I had to hitch a ride back to the NY  Not much fun     
 The 528 is a beautiful car  but mine was a lemon  It drives extremely well  is very comfortable and is solid  But it was in the shop 20 times in 2 years for a host of mostly minor but extraordinarily irritating problems  What was most galling was the attitude of the dealer  They treated me as if I were privileged to have such a car and that I should enjoy coming to the dealership  which required a 2 hour detour from my normal route  And what I cannot understand is why the manufacturer would not apologize profusely to me and try to make me happy instead of having a  quot consultant quot  call me in response to my letters and try to placate me with a few free accessories  If I were them  I would have said to me quot We are extremely sorry  Please let us buy the car back from you and replace it with a non lemon  We want your complete satisfaction quot  Instead  they have made a non friend for life  And what is worse I tell all my friends the same story Like another reviewer  I compare this experience with that of owning a 1993 Camry  It was in the shop once in 5 years  for a seat belt jam  I was treated like a king  Now a Camry is obviously not a BMW  but the overall experience of ownership was 10 times better  Another minor oddity  The 5 speed transmission has a strangely long  quot throw quot  in the shifter and in the clutch  As a result  shifting can be less quick and precise than I would like  A safety note  While the BMW is overall a very safe car  the sight lines are poor in some areas  The headrests in the back seat impede the vision backing up  and the pillars in front and back can block your vision merging sometimes  This has actually proven dangerous to me a couple of times  It can be overcome through caution  but still it seems strange to me br br  
 I recently had the opportunity to trade my 97 Chevy suburban for my brothers 2000 ML430 for a 4 day period  he had to tow a large boat  amp  I was more than happy to accommodate him  I found the ML430 to be a pleasure to drive  This vehicle handled like a sports car  held corners like it was part of the road  amp  had enough acceleration to merge into speeding LIE traffic at 70mph from very short on ramps  The dash board layout is very simple  all gauges were easily viewable from all seat positions  Seat  lock  window  amp  moonroof controls were all easily accessible  amp  user friendly  I found the in dash  outside temperature gauge to be extremely useful when the road was wet  amp  temps were hovering in the mid 30 s  The seats were extremely comfortable  amp  I had plenty of headroom  even at 6 2 quot  We also had the opportunity to take this vehicle on the beach  traditionally  we d have to deflate the tires somewhat in order to keep from spinning  amp  sinking  but the ML430 didn t require that with the very wide  low profile tires  There also was no evidence of transmission fatigue after our beach run  The only problem I had was the overall lack of room  I have a wife  amp  3 children  amp  we re used to the abundance of room in the large SUV  There wasn t enough room for fishing gear  bicycles  amp  incidentals  This machine wouldn t be suitable for a family trip with 5 or more people  Hopefully they ll roll out a larger version with all the same outstanding features  When they do  they ll have another customer  This machine is ideal for sporty couples  amp  families of 4 or less     
 Toyota Land Cruiser This is a great car and I would expect nothing less  All Japanese made cars have great engines  very powerful and productive  and last a long time  I know this because I have had one for many years  it now has 175 000 miles on it  and it still runs smoothly  This car is very heavy duty if you are looking for a SUV this is the one of the only descent ones on the market  It has all time four wheel drive  a luxurious interior and a good looking exterior  very smooth looking  It is also very very safe because you are so high of the ground and weigh much more than most other cars  So if you are in the mood for a descent SUV and you are serious about it go pick up a Toyota Land Cruiser  I highly recommend it     
 I must admit that  being a first time SUV owner  I was a little worried about how driving an SUV would feel  I worried for nothing  The Ford Explorer drives almost exactly like a car  The only difference being that in a tight corner  I feel slightly more lateral push  although this could be my imagination since I ve only had the thing for a few months  and there is a little getting used to sitting up so high I haven t gotten an opportunity to try out the four wheel drive feature as of yet  other than a little bit of playing around in the mud  but what little I ve done seems to be rock solid  I can t wait for a chance to play around with it in some  quot real quot  snow The 4 0 liter six cylinder SOHC V6 engine seems to be powerful enough for the Explorer  I don t have any problems with acceleration even when getting on the highway from a complete stop The seats in the Explorer are extremely comfortable  I do a lot of long distance driving  and I ve been able to drive for about 7 hours without a need to stop to stretch my legs  I haven t been able to do that with any other vehicle  The only real downside to the Explorer is the same thing that would be a downside for any SUV  gas mileage  I seem to be getting around 17 18 mpg with mixed driving  On highway only driving I am getting right around 19 5 20 mpg  While this isn t terrible  it s a lot less than you can get with some cars On the downside upside  there have been a few recalls made on the vehicle  The downside part of this is that there were problems with it coming out of the gate  but the upside is that Ford realizes they are there  and has fixes for them  The recalls that I ve seen have been relatively minor  a secondary hood latch and a speed control cable for the cruise control I ve had to take my vehicle in once for service in the two months I ve had it  this is probably not a normal occurrence  since mine was a demo that already had 5000 miles on it  and who knows how many drivers  The trip to the mechanic was for a bad harness in the side impact air bag  and a squeaky front wheel which required a new outer seal From some of the reviews that I ve read  the road clearance of this car isn t as high as some of the other SUVs  and I would say that for this reason  if you re planning on doing a lot of heavy offroad driving  that you probably want to look elsewhere for an SUV  but for everyone else  I would definitely suggest that you take a good look at the Explorer  It s a wonderful all around vehicle br br  
 I needed a vehicle with enough room to seat 4 people  2 in car seats  Four doors was something of a must as the extra 2 doors help to make the process of buckling in youngsters go a little smoother  I also wanted something that would be easy on gas as I do a lot of driving  My search did not start out with the Focus in mind  rather I looked at and test drove most of the cars in its class before making a decision  The main selling point for us on this vehicle was the test drive  The car surprised me at how quiet it is and the ride was also good for a small car  Gas mileage on the sticker was posted as 28 city  and 36 highway  The only thing I was not impressed with on the test drive was the visibility but I ll get to that later  A quick check to see how the car seats fit in the back and the rest was a matter of settling on a final price with our local dealer  After owning the Focus for about a month I am still very happy with my choice but there are a few gripes I have with this vehicle  The exterior styling of the sedan version leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion but also contributes to two shortcomings  I can t see the front end of the car nor can I see the back end  from the drivers seat  Pay close attention to this on the test drive as it may prove to be unacceptable to some drivers  The base engine is adequate for the flat terrain where I live but I d opt for the stronger Zetec option if I lived in a hilly or mountainous region  I would also have preferred an extra inch of cleaning surface on the drivers side windshield wiper  One thing to keep in mind when car shopping in this class is the list of standard options  I believe Ford was a little stingy in this respect  Aside from floor mats  rear defrost  interior trunk release  passive anti theft system and AM FM cassette most of the other standard options on the LX sedan are very basic  If you want ABS  AC  automatic transmission  etc  you ll need to add potentially expensive options  Fortunately the gripes have been mild and my overall impression remains high  The 5 speed transmission and clutch have proven thus far to be the smoothest I have used  The car does not have a workmanship defect that I have found and has not needed any repair  The mixed bag of driving I do has yielded almost 32mpg  Driving position is comfortable and the air conditioner has been more than up to the job  According to our insurance agent rates for this vehicle are pretty much average for a small car  As a final bonus the trunk holds more than I expected from a car in this class although the high trunk probably contributes to the lack of rear visibility  If you re in the market for a small car you ll of course want to check out epinions com but might also want to take a look at http carpoint msn com homepage default asp You can check specs  rebate information  pricing  invoice and retail  check safety ratings  compare with similar vehicles  etc  
 We wanted a full size conversion van mostly for comfort during long trips with the family  My oldest son is over 6 2 quot  tall  and our Astro van  just couldn t fit him anymore  We needed more room  We have really enjoyed our van  It s a 1997 model  We had some minor problems with the van  but the dealer took care of them in a professional manor  We are very pleased with the service we ve received from the dealer and the van itself  I wouldn t hesitate to buy another Ram Van  We really love ours  As I said earlier  we bought it mostly for long trips  but I use it s space on a daily basis  When I have to wait for my kids somewhere  I can nap  relax and read  or watch television in the van  It s makes my waiting for them so much nicer  If there is a downside  it s also what we like the most about it it s big and can be difficult to maneuver  It also loves gasoline and only gets about 13 miles to the gallon     
 Okay  When I was in highschool and turned 16 I couldn t wait to get my first car  Well  like most 16 year old girls  you dream of getting the sporty  cherry red  convertible type of car  Well people  I didn t get it  What I got was a used 1990 Ford Escort  It was dark blue and frankly just didn t look to  quot cool quot  to me  you know how highschool is  Everything has to be  quot cool quot  what is up with that But anyway I had to drive it  My dad paid only  5 000 for it and how was I going to by myself a car at 16  Needless to say  I really grew to love that car  It got great gas mileage  It never gave me any major problems  It was always reliable  And  this may seem corny  it seemed to  quot fit quot  me perfect you know  it didn t seem like I was driving a big boat Well I drove that car for nine years up until a few months ago  told you it was reliable  until I got to where I could buy a new car  I was on a mission for a new car maybe something sporty  cherry red you know  But what did I end up buying  ANOTHER Ford Escort  That s right people  I couldn t help it  I bought a used 1998 Ford Escort SE  It had 14 000 miles on it and I got a really good deal on it  about  9 500  I just knew I would be happy with it  And that it would last a long time  And just like I knew I would  I am very happy with it  It s got the same great qualities as my  quot old quot  Escort when I first got it and actually  the body style of the new Escorts look GREAT  So  if your looking for a nice looking car  reasonably priced  reliable car the Ford Escort SE  to put in the terms of my highschool days  is pretty  quot COOL quot br br  
 I opted for the 2 3 model rather than the 3 0 because  driving so many miles a year  I was concerned about fuel economy   You ll never see ME driving a gas guzzling SUV  I honestly do not miss the extra power  At better than 150 horses  the 2 3 accelerates nimbly  And once the car s up to cruising speed  for me  around 80 mph  you never miss those two extra cylinders The trunk is amply sized  with a ski pass through in the rear seat  The back seat is comfortable enough on short jaunts  I ve been back there for 150 miles in someone else s CL  but probably wouldn t be so great for a taller person  I m 5 6 quot  tall  But let s face it  most coupes  including the CL  aren t really billed as a passenger vehicles Perhaps the most compelling thing I can say about how I feel about this car is that  even though I have it on lease until spring of 2001  I ve already talked to my brother in law  my  quot car guy quot  about buying the car at the end of the lease  Common sense  and my dad  say   quot Don t do it quot  But I love the car so much I may not be able to part with it  I d really miss all those total strangers who approach to tell me what a gorgeous car I have br br  
 While the Ford Taurus is a comfortable  and rather inexpensive car  it won t get high ratings from our family  True to form  this car has lived up to the FORD reputation of  quot Fix Or Repair Daily quot  Bought used after our beloved Jetta was totaled in an accident  this car seemed promising at the start  The front seats are plush and comfortable  The back seat is roomy enough for children  fits two car seats easily  but the middle seat is hard and uncomfortable  An arm rest can be brought down in the middle  and there s even a lap shoulder belt for the middle seat  but it feels like you re sitting on a rock hard surface  The back seats also folds down to expand the trunk room for hauling larger items The trunk itself is fairy large  not quite comparable to the roominess of a VW Jetta s trunk  but still plenty of room for playpens or groceries  The air conditioner and heater work well  but sometimes seem slow to kick in  The stereo system is an iffy item  On one hand  it has decent sound  and provides enough bass to make most music palatable  while on the other hand it is part of the console and pretty much irreplaceable  I wouldn t advise buying this car if you re the type to pop stereo systems in and out However nice the amenities seemed at first  we started having problems with it  It features a faulty Ford transmission that s always begging for repair  slipping in and out of gear  If you use any brake pads other than the Ford ones  they squeal  squeak  and squawk within a thousand miles  The disc pads do not just go in with a C Clamp either  you have to buy a special tool that looks like a little block  This makes a simple job a pain to complete Overall  while the Ford Taurus may be inexpensive  fairly comfortable  and feature decent power  it is no fun to constantly be repairing something or trying to figure out just what is squeaking this time  This Taurus needs to be put out to pasture br br  
 As our family expanded we found it hard to fit everything we needed in to our 1998 Honda Accord and we definately couldn t fit our stuff into our other car which was a 1986 Honda Prelude  As much as we loved our cars it was time to move to a family van  We did major research on all vans except the Ford Windstar  I wasn t willing to look at a Ford right off the bat because my parents had both had Ford cars in the past and had had nothing but trouble with them  But as we researched and test drove other vans we weren t overly impressed with any of them  My husband finally convinced me to at least look at the Ford Windstar  Thank goodness he did  I was skeptical at first but five minutes into the test drive I was in love  The leg room very impressive  I sat in one of the captains chairs in the middle as my husband and the salesman sat in the front  The seats are very comfortable and wide  The color also helped as I loved the deep red color with the beige undertone  The front and rear air conditioning is great  When there are no windows to roll down in the back it is nice to be able to turn up the air conditioning a little more than the people in the front might need  After we finished the test drive I went home and did research on the Ford Windstar as I was still a lit nervous about buying a Ford  When my inquiries found that it was also highly recommended I jumped at the oppurtunity to purchase it At first I was a little nervous about driving the Windstar having never driven anything but small to mid sized cars in the past  After only a day I was totally comfortable driving it because it handled great  I found the van to be very responsive with great acceleration power and easy handling We have owned the Windstar for nearly one year now and have never had to make any repairs or bring it in to the shop for anything more then routine maintenance Iwas also impressed the first time I went grocery shopping and realized just how much trunk space there really is  My opinion is that the Windstar would be a great minivan for any family or anyone who wants a reliable  comfortable  and good looking minivan br br  
 I am currently leasing a 1998 black Hyundai Tiburon  After my initial excitement  I wasn t sure how much I was going to enjoy my three year lease because our local dealer unexpectedly stopped carrying Hyundai and refused to do any service  if needed  on the car  The closet dealership would now be two hours away  I was very apprehensive that something would go wrong with the car and it would be a hassle  but I could not have been more wrong  It has been almost two years on my lease and my Tiburon has performed beautifully in all areas not even a pesky rattle  It is a wonderful car to take on vacations because although it is small  when the back seat is folded down it actually holds more stuff than our 4 door Dodge Stratus  Also  it is a very sharp car to drive and there are not many on the road  People are always stopping me in parking lots to ask me about my car  It definitely is an attention getter  if that s what you re after   And incidentally  a new Hyundai dealership has recently opened up in town br br  
 While on the market for a used car  I had no clue what I was going to get  I had been to several car dealerships and none had treated me and my family with so much kindness and helpfulness as the Saturn dealer that I went to in Huntington  Long Island  They were so nice and helpful and helped me to pick out the  quot perfect car quot  I currently drive a  94 Saturn SL2  it s a special addition so it is a pearly white color and is fully automatic  This car has been through so much and handled everything wonderfully  It has traction control so it doesn t slip on ice  snow  or rain  It has a sun roof for those nice beach days  and fully automatic front and rear windows for those drive through windows at McDonald s  This car was definitely worth the price tag that I paid I paid in total with taxes and etc  about  10 000  It was a pretty big investment for me  a 17 year old with a part time job at Old Navy  but it was worth every hard earned penny  Saturn owners usually are very happy with their cars  and I am definitely a very happy Saturn owner  They are very safe cars  with dent proof doors and dual airbags in the front dashboard  I have never had a major problem with my car  but I know that if I ever did that they would be extra helpful and very speedy on the repair  I am very impressed with Saturn as a company and with the condition of my car it looks brand new and it is 6 years old already br br  
 Back in 1997  we purchased a 1993 Ford Taurus Wagon  We purchased the car because we needed a larger car for our family  The car had problems the moment we drove it off the lot  As we were driving down the expressway in our  quot new quot  car  the Oxygen sensors went out  meaning the car would stall out going 65MPH  We called the dealership  and they fixed them  assuring us that the car had been very well taken care of  and this was just a strange coincidence  Well  2 weeks later  the brakes went out  so we got them fixed  Then the head gasket went out  And now the transmission is out in it  We have only had this car for a little over 2 years  and we have sunk more money into it than we had to pay for it even though we had a warranty  I will make sure a mechanic checks out the next car I purchase  and I would advice anyone to do the same     
 Wow  Out of curiosity I started reading the Taurus reviews  They only confirmed my suspicions  I think the Taurus tends to be a lot like a cocker spaniel  If you know cockers you will find they come in good and bad  It seems they have two very different temperments  Laid back and affectionate would be type one  Nasty and very apt to bite is the second type  With the Taurus you have the dependable joy to drive car  and also  the  Found on Road Dead  type My  91 Taurus couldn t have been a better car for me  We did have a period of unreliability due to a bad alternator  It took 3 tries to get an alternator that would work for more than a day or two  but that can happen with any car  After that  it was clear sailing all the way  I really can t say too much bad about this car at all I bought this  91 Taurus in  95 from a dealer We paid  10 000 for a nicely loaded car  It had all the options I could have wanted  My favorite options being the automatic windows and seats have continued to work well  needing no repairs as of yet  Now that this car is almost 11 years old I couldn t really complain too much if things started to go although  I hope it continues to hold up for awhile  This is absolutely the most comfortable car I have ever driven  I am just under 5  tall and still I need not worry about sitting on a pillow or anything stupid like that  I have had that problem with other cars in the past  The automatic seats adjust all over the place making it easy to get a comfortable fit  Also  they are very easy to adjust even while driving  I like this because if you start to feel cramped  tired and uncomfortable you can just move a button or two and the change of position eases the discomfort right away The body of this car has held up well  We are very bad at keeping it washed and waxed and it is just now starting to show some rust  We are also very bad at managing to get the oil changes on time  Still the engine is doing fine  Nothing has really broken down on this car  We did have to replace the knobs recently that work all the heating and air conditioning settings  They just seemed to wear out and fall off a lot  The only really annoying thing we had a problem with is that the trunk had a tendency to pop open while you were driving down the highway  We did manage to correct that problem  Now  I feel safe and secure when driving this older car around  It has always been very reliable  I never had any problem with getting stuck anywhere due to a car problem As good as this car has been  I am starting to get a little worried  I do know a lot of people that have had nothing but trouble with the Taurus  and we are some of those people  We also have a  93 Taurus that I hate  It has been just as unreliable as the other one has been reliable  There is 160 000 miles on the Taurus I love and a lot less on the other car  It really shouldn t be in the condition it seems to be in  I have heard that they tend to die about the time you hit the 100 000 mark  I do know that several that have done that exact thing  I am beginning to get nervous about driving it because of the record of some of the others  I want to buy a new car soon  or a  new for me but slightly used  car  I would love to have another Taurus but because I keep hearing bad stories about the Taurus owned by others  I am leary of doing this  I must make up my mind soon  If I don t get another Taurus I plan to try to find a car as similiar as I can to the Taurus  It is the perfect size and shape for me  
  Putting it in Perspective  Your standard American sedan  i e  Ford Taurus  Toyota Camry  etc  in Europe is a  HUGE  car   no kidding  Gas prices are so high there that most people drive smaller  more fuel economic cars  which in turn create an extremely competitive market for this class of automobile So much that Ford has a completely separate division in Europe  that designs cars especially for its market  there aren t any Contours in Europe  It was this division that mostly conceived and designed the Focus  and appropriately so Frankly  American designers simply cannot design a successful compact car   GM s  quot Geo quot  line was a complete disaster  and the  quot Escort quot  name was taking the perception of the  quot Pinto quot  But having a small  affordable car with an affordable price tag is extremely lucrative to car manufacturers  ask Honda  they have the Civic line My point is that when Ford decided to be serious about this class of automobile  they didn t fool around and went straight the the professionals   the European division s designers b Exterior  Let s face it  the exterior styling is cool  Compare this to the Focus  replacement  the Escort  Or consider bland styling of the Sentra  Corolla  Neon  Sephia and Civic  Sleek lines  sporty look and european flair make this a very good looking car on the road b Interior  Roomy  spacious and inviting  the Focus  interior makes very efficient use of the overall car area  The dashboard has curving lines and well placed controls not found in other cars in it s class  Seating areas are moderately comfortable  with a surprising amount of room in the front and rear seats  As nice as it is  though  I couldn t imagine sitting more than 3 hours in this car  but my little sister  who owns this car  is young enough to live in it b Engine  Powertrain  Well  what do you expect for 13 15k  It s got a peppy 130hp engine that is quick enough for a little excitement  but not really fast enough to grab attention of the local law enforcement agencies  I think Ford might benefit from having a turbo edition in the lineup  just to make this car a little more exciting on the gas pedal On the inside  the engine is a bit loud  but since most of these kids put ear deafening mufflers on their cars  or listen to music at a bone rattling volume  this really isn t a problem b Ride  I found the Focus to be surprisingly nimble around the corners  The ZX3 is especially sporty  with 15 quot  wheels and 130hp standard  The point  really  is to look cool  not be comfortable over bumps  If you want comfort  check out my review on the Cadillac Seville b Overall  Overall  I think the Focus is a great deal for the money you re paying  Given it s great styling inside and out  I m pleasantly surprised that Ford designed this  It s no surprise  of course  that it s concept came from Europe  Perhaps my biggest beef is the power  put a turbo on that thing Note  I don t own this car  my little sister does  I drive it when she s not looking  p   
 Get an old Tempo and stick to your beat   Yes  we re talking music here   I have been and still am the proud owner of three Ford Tempos  A l987  a 1989 and a l990  I am a woman who drives approximately 40 to 80 miles a day in all kinds of weather  I am a consistent driver  in that I keep relatively the same speed for the same length of time while commuting to and from work  These cars are easy to drive and easy to control  They are great in snow and icy conditions  They have a front wheel drive that s excellent WITHOUT snow tires  and I live in Northern New York State  near the Canadian border  The gas mileage is great and at a steady pace of just below 55 miles and hour I use almost no gas at all  If you re a careful driver  mind the speed limit and don t peel out too often  I d sure recommend a Tempo to you  There s just nothing about these low key cars I don t like  I ve been driving them for 12 years  Blue Book value should increase  in my opinion  br br  
 To start  let me state that what is defined in terms of an economy car  12 000 to upwards of almost 17 000 on some models  is a large chunk of money for me  This is my main car  I test drove a Mazda Protege  Nissan Sentra  Toyota Corolla  Honda Civic  and Dodge Neon  I bi passed Saturn  Kia  and Daewoo due to lackluster reviews  I choose the Ford Focus because I actually felt like I was buying a much more expensive  well equipped car than any of the competition offered for the same money  The Ford Focus must and should be compared to other cars in its class  It is not a Lexus or a BMW  However  it IS a very nice offering  It is very spacious for a small sedan  I personally find the seats exceedingly comfortable   the front bucket seats give a feeling of being slightly raised with a comfy chair like quality  The dash is simple and sleek   I find the controls very simple to read  some reviewers think they are complicated  My model is the SE with an upgrade to the sports group which includes the more powerful ztec engine  The SE comes equipped with standard air  power windows and mirrors  keyless entry and a cd  Very nice  Easy to operate and convenient  As for the exterior design   I think it is sporty and sleek  Mine is the sports group  so it has the spoiler  The twilight blue  dark blue  metallic is fierce  It doesn t look like everyone and his brother s Honda and Toyota   Like I said I test drove both the corolla and civic and was very disappointed   small interiors  tinny feel  sparse equipment for the money   they are starting to really operate on name and past reputation   it was like they didn t even try  The ride and handling on this car is great  Crisp handling  more than adequate power with the upgraded engine  I don t know about the lower grade engine   test drive and see for yourself  The ztec zips up the hills of my hilly New England town  I have the five speed for the added boost  and the manual is the choice from all the professional reviews I have read  which are plenty  including Consumer Reports  In sum  I would highly recommend test driving this car  if you are in the market for a small sedan  with a big car feel  It was the only car I test drove and felt it was worth endeavoring on car payments  I realize that Fords past reliability record is a consideration  I must admit it did give me pause  but this car seems smooth and very well put together  Let s hope Ford turns it around with this car  My final word   love it  love it  love it  love it  love it  love it  love  sleek and cool the little groovy car that could br br  
 Through a bizarre series of family events  I attained my 1990 Ford Mustang 5 0 LX hatchback for free  I had just got my license a week ago  so I was thrilled to receive such a legendary car as my first car  and completely for free  I mean  you re a 17 year old male  how could you say no to 225 horsepower  300 ft lbs of torque  a V8 engine with a few modifications here and there  The owner before me was quite the drag racing enthusiast  so the mods included  stabilizer bars  dual Flowmaster exhaust  and ram air intake  The only thing I didn t like at the time was that it was automatic transmission  But no worries  it was free  and I saved my mother at least  4 000 Ya know  maybe I had a lemon  I know how to take care of cars  I never raced it  and I treat my property with the utmost respect  But within the second week  there was a major transmission problem  it wouldn t go over 45 mph  I guess it wouldn t change into the next gear  all it did was rev high  My entire transmission had to be rebuilt  totaling about  1 750  My mother and I said to ourselves   Okay  this is just one problem  We ll get it fixed  then that ll be it Next thing I know  I m stuck in traffic on Highway 4 and smoke is coming out from under my hood  I call up a friend who knows more about cars than I  and he suggests it s an old thermostat that should be replaced  So over a weekend  he and I replace the thermostat with relatively no trouble  besides a few bruised and cut fingers  After that  the car ran like a chime  For about a week  Just today  in fact  I was stuck in traffic  My temperature gauge read normal  but there was smoke coming from underneath the car this time  It seems that there are too many problems for me to justify keeping the car  oil leak  improper alignment  squeaky brakes  wobbly power windows  the overheating  insurance  attention from cops  etc  Most of the things I ve mentioned can be fixed  but the thing is that after I fix it  I know something else will turn up  I guess it just comes with the territory of a muscle car There are things I like about the car  Its loud and growly exhaust never gets tiring  It s fast and powerful  With 300 ft lbs of torque  you can dust your everyday ricer and make them feel stupid for putting on those pointless decals  You get plenty of attention when cruising past the theater on a Friday night  With ritualistic washing and detailing  the car looks beautiful  even if it has its share of dings and dents  But I m afraid that the problems I ve had outweigh the things I like about the car If you re into fun driving  I don t suggest this car  It ll give you good quarter mile times  but don t expect to do any canyon carving with this car  I mean  you could  but I know that I m too scared of going into uncontrollable oversteer and driving off of a cliff  Heck  my airbag isn t even functional right now So I m looking into selling the  Stang  It was a decent car while its problems remained hidden  Besides  I m into  fun  driving  Can you say Mazda Miata  Toyota MR2 Turbo  They may not beat a  Stang or Camaro on the strip  but personally  I see the bends more often than a quarter mile strip  And the thrill I get of downshifting and upshifting around a series of corners is much more exciting than getting low 9s at the strip  
 Greetings  What follows is a blow by blow account of a head to head comparison test of the Ford Contour and the Plymouth Breeze  If you own or are thinking of purchasing either of these vehicles  this should prove to be very interesting reading for you  I have toned it down to about 1 300 words  in the interest of not posting a novel here on Epinions com   Earlier today  I found myself with an interesting assignment  to pick which of two cars was the  quot better quot  car  A close friend was shopping for a compact sedan  but she hated the idea of not buying American  After much discussion  mostly related to styling  she narrowed it down to two cars  the Ford Contour and the Plymouth Breeze You see  this all began several weeks ago when my friend s car  a wheezy old 1987 Ford Mustang  was diagnosed as needing a new automatic transmission within the next month or so  The car was driveable  but definitely on the way out  Knowing that I am a  quot car guy quot  she called me up and asked me what she should buy  choosing from only compact  four door North American models that can be bought for well under  20 000  she was thinking  18 000 or less We immediately ruled out the Pontiac Grand Am as she felt the styling was simply too funky for her more conservative tastes  especially the dashboard which appears to have been lifted straight out of a sci fi movie  I actually like it myself  She also ruled out the Ford Focus  as it too struck her as a little too weird  Interestingly  she really liked the looks of the Ford Contour  She also liked the design of the Plymouth breeze  saying that is was definitely  quot neato quot  and was not too weird for her So  having effectively narrowed it down to a used Ford Contour or a Plymouth breeze  we set out in search of a prime example of each  She decided that she would probably be best off to pick up a used 1999 model of the car she chose as this would save her several thousand dollars  you know the scenario  champagne taste  Coca Cola budget So  as luck would have it  after lots of searching for a couple of really clean cars  we happened to find one of each on the same used car lot  a red 1999 Plymouth Breeze with 24 000 miles  and a white Ford Contour with 25 400 miles  Both were automatics  and had power windows  door locks  and mirrors  AM FM cassette stereos  cloth interiors  and 4 cylinder engines  We drove the Breeze first Inside  the Plymouth breeze is deceivingly roomy  There is plenty of room for four 6 foot adults to get comfortable  The back seat even features a nifty fold down and pull out dual cupholder in the back of the front armrest  The opposite was true of the Ford Contour  The back seats are tight for six footers  and rear headroom is non existent  Hitting a nice bump on the freeway would definitely result in the rear passengers bumping their heads on the roof if they were 5 9 quot  or taller  The breeze won that one hands down  It feels much larger from any seating position  even though on the outside it s almost the same size as the Contour The Breeze has the nicer looking gauge cluster  and more in the way of interior storage compartments  Of course  as is typical of Chrysler company products the interior looked and felt like it was put together on a strict  under allocated  budget  The plastics are definitely rental car grade  and the controls do feel unsubstantial and sort of rubbery On the other hand  the Contour was missing something I insist on in any car I drive  a tachometer  Even with an automatic  a tach can be very useful  especially in a car with overdrive transmission  The Contour feels smaller  both in terms of interior space and overall size  Without a doubt the plastics used on the dash are of higher quality than those found in the Breeze  The steering wheel in the Contour scored major points with me for it s thick  meaty feel  Conversely  the steering wheel in the Breeze is nothing special and is immediately forgettable Despite being direct competitors  these two cars feel very  very different  The Breeze feels more like a typical American car in that it feels large and roomy  and it handles like a small boat  Road feel is not a term with which Plymouth is well acquainted  The steering is vague and uncommunicative  leaving the driver feeling like they are driving a small Buick Conversely  the Contour  derived from the hugely successful European Ford Mondeo  offers the driver excellent road feel  For an enthusiast  this makes the drive more fun and makes the car more predictable  inspiring more spirited driving  For the average consumer the Contours excellent steering imparts a feeling of having better control over the vehicle  thus making them feel safer   This elusive trait is why BMWs are known as the  quot ultimate driving machine quot  The road feel in a BMW is quite simply the very best in the world As for power  neither car is exactly a road rocket  but thanks to its superior handling  the Contour feels both faster and much more fun to drive  In all honesty  the Ford felt faster from a standstill  although we obviously did not conduct instrumented testing  The Ford s brakes were definitely better than those in the Breeze  but bear in mind that both were used cars Surprisingly  both cars have great trunks  One would expect the Contour to have a small trunk  and while it s not as deep as that found on the Breeze  it is surprisingly large and usable  Of course  the Breeze s trunk ultimately is the larger of the two One of the biggest subjective differences between these two vehicles is the quality of materials and level of fit and finish  The Ford felt like it was put together very well  in fact  if I may be so bold  it felt downright European  Conversely  the Breeze felt like it was good for maybe another 50 00 miles before it came apart at the seams  The plastics are super cheap  and squeaks and rattles were certainly noticeable  The Breeze left us with the impression that we had driven a cheap car  while the Contour felt like a shoe string budget BMW wannabe  no kidding So  which did we choose  In case you haven t guessed yet  she bought the Contour  We both felt good about the purchase  especially since we negotiated a great deal on the car  She is thrilled  and she especially likes the styling of the Contour  When we took a good long look at it  she felt the Breeze looked like a plastic toy  especially the grill and mirrors  and I must admit that the front end of the Contour is very pleasing to look at  The cat s eye headlamps are very elegant Apparently  the Contour is one of Ford s most reliable products  Time will tell  and I must admit that I am somewhat pessimistic about its projected life span  Of course  it s not a Plymouth  I am not a fan of Chrysler products  so I definitely think she picked the better built car Overall  I was very impressed with the Ford s performance and overall packaging  except the rear seat headroom thing  I had pretty much written Ford off as a manufacturer of below average quality automobiles with little or no finesse  the new Focus excluded  A pleasant surprise  I could actually sort of envision myself driving a Ford product and actually liking it for the first time in years  of course  I would probably opt for the 6 cylinder SVT Contour All in all  the Ford struck me as the better car  I think she choose wisely  Of course  neither car would hold a candle to a used Nissan Altima  Honda Civic  or VW Jetta in my books  But hey  this car wasn t for me  My pal insisted on an American car  and I personally think she got a great set of wheels for her money   br br  
 I just got rid of this vehicle  My family bought it used in 1995 and it was my first car that I had driven from the moment I learned to drive until just a few weeks ago  During the time that I owned the vehicle the rotor cracked causing the wheel to fall off  luckily while moving slowly  The air conditioner went bad around 60K miles and never really worked again after several repairs  The transmission started failing before 100K and finally went out around 110K miles  I had the transmission replaced and it began to fail only 15K miles later  The water pump also went out and the brakes began to stick  Even though only the first rust spots were beginning to form on the vehicle  it felt as though it was only a matter of days before something else would go wrong  so I traded it in for a 2000 Pontiac Sunfire  Unfortunately  the dealer would only offer  450 for the trade in value because of its poor condition  This poor condition  after 127 000 miles was only the result of regular wear and tear and more than  5000 invested in repairs over the course of 5 years  If you are a regular mechanic and think you can get a bargain on this vehicle then go for it  but otherwise I would recommend steering clear br br  
 Owning a ford windstar myself  i feel it is a wonderful minivan  It is roomy  and has a very comfortable feel  My family has always invested in ford minivans and thinks that beyond a doubt  the windstar is the best of them all  Beyond space concerns  the sound system is very good  and provides a professional stereo effect  It has many other features  too many of which to mention right here  but i do recommend this fine car for research  The Ford website should provide all this info  This minivan is perfect for entertaining children  carrying many objects and has impressive handling for a heavy car such as it is  It ranges in usefullness from soccer mom care and grocery buying to massive vacation packing to transporting furniture  I honestly do not know what i would do with such a minivan  it is undeniably a needed part of my life br br  
 my volkswagen is a piece of garbage  please see my other review of this car fortunately  the fairbanks vw dealer gave me a complimentary plastic coffee mug that fits in the cup holder in my new golf  but the holder is consistently in the way of either my cd player or the vents  and it doesn t fold out the way it s supposed to when you push the  eject  button  finally  no matter how you try to seat your mug  it always tips forward  if it s really full and slightly leaky  like the one i got from the dealer  it will dump all over the vent stereo heater controls my car went in for it s 5000 mile check up last thursday  and it needs a new o2 sensor  a part that must be ordered  the o2 sensor is the widget that detects the fuel air mixture that s going into the engine  i presume that a faulty one will allow the engine to run less efficiently  i was told that they commonly go bad in the cold  it has been  20F for a few weeks  but still  the car is only 5000 miles old  oh well check this out  in another epinion review  vw new jetta  i think  someone was complaining about vw s customer service  i agree  the service department is fine  so far  but the salespeople i dealt with were wretched  here is an excerpt from an email i sent to a friend when i tried to buy the golf the first time  i gave up  and tried again with a different salesperson several months later  in this tale  my salesman s name was  quot porter quot quot we had been haggling for  10 days  porter was irritating and hard to get on the phone  this other guy at the dealership put endless pressure on me to lease  i still don t know why  but yesterday we finally settle on a price  5  over invoice  not too bad for a popular car  consumer reports says 4 8  i went in there with my checkbook  and we start filling out forms  insurance stuff  credit applications  yadda yadda yadda  after 2 hours  porter takes me outside and tells me that he made a mistake  the car we ve been  quot working the deal quot  on is not the one i test drove twice  its a different one without the  1000  quot luxury package quot  there s no way he can sell me the car i want for the price we agreed on  he needs another  1000  this would put my purchase price  650 OVER the msrp  what was he thinking  so i left  after berating him loudly for several minutes  what an amazing waste of my time  i will try to get ahold of his boss  i guess  but i ve already wasted so much time quot the real tragedy is that the second time i went in  i was in a hurry because my truck had just thrown a rod  i knew it s engine could go at any minute  so i wanted a new vehicle pronto  i ended up getting hosed by the dealer  paying more for my golf without the  quot luxury package quot  than i had originally offered porter i like my little car though  it s quick enough and it has a functioning heater  something my truck lacked  i also like the stereo  but i think i ll get a subwoofer  it has been on several road trips  and is comfortable over the long haul br br  
 I love mustangs  Of course I was brought up in a ford loving family  but that really doesnt matter  Well  I bought this vehicle because of its sleek new look and its well known name  well besides being a ford lover There isn t to much you could hate about this vehicle  I mean  it looks good  it handles good  and it is decently quick  Oh yeah  you can also roast the tires right off of it s rims  not a bad accessory in my opinnion  It s only down fall for the GT  is that it doesn t have the power you would expect from Mustang  But all in all it is a great car for a small family  gas mileage isn t bad  and it has great pickup on the highway if you live in a large city  I think that anybody would enjoy themselves in one of these great vehicles  whether or not it is a six cylinder or a V 8 br br  
 I ve had my 1992 Ford Explorer for awhile now and it is still in great shape with no major problems so far I can feel it s age  but it does run nicely for an almost 8 year old vehicle  The biggest problem is city driving  The stop and go of city driving clogs up the fuel system and causes the Ford Explorer to run roughly  An easy although time consuming solution is to simply take it on a road trip  After driving for about 2 hours at 70 mph  Texas speed limit is 70 mph  using super unleaded  and the Ford Explorer purrs like a kitten again  It runs real smooth after that  A month or so of city driving starts to clog the fuel system back up though One thing I don t like about the Ford Explorer is that it only goes up to about 85 mph  Although  I must honestly admit that that is probably a good thing and has probably saved me a lot of money on speeding tickets  At least in Texas  they raised the speed limit to 70 mph  Now  ironically  we can all drive the same speed we used to drive at  but now it s legal   The biggest pain in the neck I have had with it is the air conditioning  It has gone out on me several times which is a big headache and very expensive to fix  In Texas  air conditioning is almost a necessity and the mechanics know that  so repair costs are extremely high The interior has stood up well over 8 years  And the exterior has held up well as long as I kept it well waxed  People often thought it was new after I fully detailed the vehicle  Overall  if you take care of this vehicle  it will last a very long time  The quality is remarkably good for a Ford  I am saying that since Ford tends to have a reputation  rightly or wrongly  that they make great looking vehicles  but Chevrolet makes great running vehicles  I ve been happy with this Ford Explorer and still drive it today without problems br br  
 Since its introduction in 1994  Dodge has steadily improved its groundbreaking Ram pickup to help it keep pace with newer and more sophisticated designs put out by the competition  While it retains the best looks in the market segment  the Ram has slowly fallen behind in terms of driving comfort  braking  and overall refinement  It s not a bad truck  and doesn t do anything poorly  but it s not the ultimate  Then again  it is much more affordable that some of the competition s new vehicles The Ram interior was revamped for 1998  with much improved cupholders  which take it from having some of the worst around to some of the best  They are huge  and can grip your drink so it won t fall out even in bumpy terrain  Seat design and materials were also improved  as was the general interior and dash design  In 2000  Dodge moved to improve the Ram s handling and braking characteristics  and they succeded to a degree  There is less steering slack  wandering  and braking is stronger  with less fade  Overall  the truck is rather superior to pre  98 models My overall impressions of the new RAM Looks  Top notch  Especially in 4x4 SLT trim  It s the best looking truck on the road  though it could use a sheetmetal update soon  Comfort Interior  The seats are also the best around  Big and spacious  with a great console  it doesn t even need bucket seats as an option which isn t available  The controls are all well marked and easy to use  The stereo is adequate  I would recommend an aftermarket setup rather than their overpriced upgrade CD Cassette Infiniti setup  Rear seating is not as good as the GM Silverado Sierra  but it s adequate and the Ram is better looking inside Performance handling  Never a strong point for a truck  this is probably where the Ram shows it s age the most  Though steering feel is improved  it still isn t as carlike as the competition  They have however  fixed the Ram s tendency to wander on the road  Braking is adequate  though still worst in class  Despite the  quot sport quot  models they sell  this is not a sport truck  Engine power is fine  especially with the 5 9L V 8  but it is coarse and noisy compared to the competion s models  These are 70 s design engines that have been modernized over the years  Totally new engines will accompany the new Ram in  03  I believe  On road ride is smooth  but tire noise is evident and you should drive a Toyota Tundra for an example of how quiet a pickup can actually be  But absent that  you aren t really bothered by the noise  Reliability  Dodge continues to have major problems with their transmissions  though engines seem rock solid  Be sure you have a quality dealer service department nearby before buying  because you probably will be in for warranty work  My brother s Ram required a full week in the shop for a transmission rebuild at 35 000 miles  My Ram was in 3 times in three years  and required a rebuilt overdrive unit among other repairs  The 1500 series Ram is not a good choice for towing or hauling  Try a model with a tougher auto transmission  or a manual  Service departments have run from good to terrible here  so ask around before buying Other  The paint jobs are about average for American trucks  You won t be in show condition after 5 years  but you probably won t have peeling paint either  The black tends to dull quickly  Visability is good  with the Ram s large greenhouse  Just be careful not to back over a Subaru  Fuel mileage is a weak point  with my 5 9L V 8 4x4 acheiving only 13 mpg around town   my Tundra gets about 17 mpg  but it is a 2wd model All in all  the Ram is a decent truck  especially if you don t care so much about a quiet  soft  smooth ride or sporty performance  With the recent improvements  rebates and heavy discounts  it s a great value new I would avoid used models  especially since they do have a history of transmission problems  A well equipped extended cab 4x4 can be had for  24 000 if you find the right discounts and buy from a high volume dealer Chevys  GMC s  Fords  and Toyotas do cost a little more HINT  Business owners can join their local farm bureau and get an additional  500 rebate check for details Overall  the Ram is no longer my first choice  but it is tops in comfort  looks  and regular cab spaciousness  They also have great resale value  which makes them a very affordable vehicle to own br br  
 We purchased our 97 SHO Jan  01 with 34K and in perfect shape  We decided not to opt for the additional warranty at  1300  Bad Choice  at 40K  just out of warranty  the tranny went out  After several phone calls to Ford  we buy company and personal vehicles only through them and have a huge list of loyalty cars  6 new and 3 used  and father used to own ford dealership  they offered no help for the  2600 cost of replacing it  Since then the check engine light has been on  although nothing seems to be wrong  so we have decided not to pay them to dig around to find out what is causing it  since their doesn t seem to be a problem  Just after that the tires went bad and cost us about  600 to replace them with Z rated  which is really your only choice  The alarm seems to go off in the middle of the night for no apparent reason  And also the dome light goes on and off as it pleases  which we just found out from the Ford garage that it MIGHT be  they are not sure  we just have to take the  140 gamble  an oxygen sensor  We also lost both keys and had to pay to have it towed  95  1 2 mile to the Ford garage so they can make a new one  The car is at 60K right now and the speakers have all crapped out  but you can t change them without spending some   or you can buy factory speakers but that is still   The CD player has almost entirely quit reading CD s but to replace the Console it is a mess so just live with it  The interior floormats also got stained and we are looking at  250  for new SHO floormats  But the good stuff It is really a high performance car if you know how to drive it right  Switching from an escort to this would probably be too much  This is also not the type of car you want to buy for your 16 year old  they will hurt themselves  The interior is roomy and comfortable  and the trunk is huge  2 sets of golf clubs fit perfectly  Long trips on good roads are comfy  but in town bumpy roads are a little rough and bounce you around a bit  MPG is average  about 18 on mine  For the price it comes with alot of good features like leather  sunroof  power everything  V8 235hp engine  etc  
 We bought a 1998 Chevy S10  4 cylinder extra cab  In general  I am extremely disappointed in the truck  Gets ok gas mileage  maybe 23 in the city and 26 highway  It is gutless on take off  We obviously have only owned the truck for 2 years and  at 30K miles  have already had the transmission fully redone  My father owns the same truck  a  98 single cab  and he too at 40K miles has had the transmission REPLACED  His was not on warranty anymore  refused to pay the  1600 to fix it because a transmission should last more than 40 000 miles  The dealer did replace it free of charge  Our transmission is still not functioning right  and will need to be worked on again  If I would have known then what I know now  I would have looked into the V 6 of this same truck What do I like about it  It has very comfortable seats  it s roomy  and I really like the looks of it  Ours is dark blue with grey interior and has the rubber and chrome siding  I can t help but like it because it s fun to drive and a brake from my Buick  My husband drives it the most  but I m afraid we ll have to get rid of it before the warranty runs out  A transmission is something none of us like to fool with br br  
 I bought the Ford Windstar because of the growing size of my family and because i coach a little league baseball team and needed the extra room for players without rides  The Ford Windstar is rather unique due to the fact most mini vans today look very much alike however the Windstar seems to have found a way to stand out in a crowd  I like the fact that the Windstar comes with an overhead storage area where other mini vans tend to make you scatter your belongings out around the vehicle allowing them to slide around and make a mess  The Windstar also comes with a center console storage area which makes a terrific place to store cds and tapes or road maps  The roomyness is unequaled by any other mini van  Before my wife and i bought the vehicle we looked at the Dodge Caravan which is also a great van however at the time only came with a 4 cylinder engine and didn t come with storage areas like the Windstar  however it did come with a fishnet type basket between the driver and passenger seat which kept dropping things as i hit the brakes  might as well not have anything there at all  The only thing not to like about the Windstar is gas mileage it gets approximately 20 in the city and 26 28 highway  but as anyone with a larger vehicle will tell you thats not half bad  Driving the Windstar is like riding a magic carpet  in the fact you don t have engine noise and it tends to hug the road and provide one of the smoothest rides possible from any large vehicle  I also feel safer in the Windstar than in my last vehicle  dodge neon  due to the fact it has reinforced siding and antilock brakes which has saved my children and i numerous times driving in the city  Families with one or more children should concider buying this vehicle because smaller cars will not allow you to take your family and friends in one trip  If you are single i wouldn t want a family car and wouldn t concider buying it     
 I own a 1995 Ford Probe GT24v  that I bought used  by one owner  early 2000  I was attracted to this car because of its sporty look and its fast engine  I could not turn down the offer I got on it  It is glossy purple with custom probe wheels  The design on the GT24v is different compared to regular Probe GT s  The back panel by the rear license plate has a unique GT design where the license plate would be on a regular GT  I think it stands out a lot more than the average Ford Probe GT  It is very sporty and also very speed The tires are wider than the Ford Probe SE  Which creates a smoother ride and better handling  Be sure you get a standard  I could not imagine driving a car like this in an automatic  It would take the fun out of it It does not ride more than four comfortably  The front seats are very spacious and roomy  Although  the back seats are not as pleasurable  You normally end up strattling the seats  It has a large trunk that is ideal for trips  I recommend getting the car fully loaded  The premium items are well worth your money  For example  A cd player  rear window wiper  electric seat adjustment  cruise control  fog lights  etc The car will treat you right if you treat it right  If you can t expect to drive it to death  and nothing to happen  After about 60 000 miles the rear calipers will need changed  The car loves to eat up those brakes  But you shouldn t experience any problems as long as you know the cars prior history and you treat it good I highly recommend that you buy this car  It is well worth the money  and you will enjoy driving it  Give it a good look next time you are shopping for a car br br  
 I just bought brand new 2000 Toyota Sienna XLE and it is Swwweet  I of course didn t think of a van being a sweet ride but this defineately is  Moon roof 6 CD changer power sliding doors heated mirrors and back seat windows plus all of the seats weigh less than fourty pounds and are totally easy to work with The air bag is designed to take out most of it s force on the windsheild so riding in the front really isn t that big of a danger any more  In this you can comfortabley seat seven peoplw plus all of their luggage and a cooler  It has extra outlets for back seat cel phones or cd players or whatever Last night that Toyota Sienna saved my life  I was riding in the middle seat and I was alseep  The driver fell asleep as well and the car rolled three times  With any other car I would have been crushed to death and hence would not be able to sit here and write this  Please remember that the Toyota Sienna save four precios lives last night br br  
 I bought my Ford Aspire in 1994 brand new off the lot  I paid  9000 out the door  I had cruise control and a stereo added and later replaced it with a CD player  At first I didn t like the car  the interior was plain  the engine had no get up and go  and I had to put up with the wise cracks about how I was driving a washing machine on wheels  But now 6 years later I still have the car  my husband drives it now  and with 125 000 miles on it the car is still going strong  500 miles a week commute  I have put 2 brake jobs on the car  changed the tires all around 3 times  changed the battery once  had one tune up  and recently replaced a rotor in the engine all in the 6 years I ve owned the car  Not to mentioned the car has slid into two ditches and hit a curb hard which inturn it needed two front end alignments and a new rim  This is all the repair I have put into the vehicle and it is still going strong  I predict this car could go 180 000  with proper maintenance and I only paid  9000 dollars for it  What a deal  As I now see it anyone who wants an affordable  reliable  and fun car should get this one  But if you are looking for performance and style steer clear  this is not the car for you FYI  the Ford Aspire is actually a Kia Avella  The car model was purchased and marketed in the states by Ford before Kia made its move in the American market  The car was 80  Kia and 20  Ford  If you are looking for a car similar to the Ford Aspire in todays market check out the Kia Sephia the body style and features are different but under the hood is pretty much the same     
 Buying a couple of used Honda Accords has to have been one of the smartest things I ve done  Call me boring  I don t care  these things last The first one I bought in 1997  It is a 1990 Accord EX 5 spd  power everything  and it had about 120K miles on it  A sales rep had owned it and took care of it as if it were his first born child  Two and a half years later  the car has about 150K miles on it  and I haven t done anything other than change the oil  I m hoping to drive this car for at least another 50K miles The second one was just purchased recently  It s a 1993 Accord SE  with all of the bells and whistles  including leather seats  airbags  etc  It has about 90K miles and runs like a dream  I had it checked out and it passed with flying colors  Bottom line  why shell out 25 grand for a new car br br  
 Well I  was  a Chevy man I had my ol  V6 Pickup without a scratch  and 165K on the clock One morning I awoke and my trusty truck was not in my driveway any more I was sad  mad  and not glad  Being a gear head  I put all my toys into the back of that pickup time and time again and could not imagine life without my white aluminum horse Looking at the new Chevys with an Extended or Crew cab made it apparent that I would not be able to park these behemoths in most situations  Besides  the less then 10MPG for a big Chevy or Ford was nearly prohibitive It was November 1999 and there were little in the way of Extended cab trucks available from anyone One day I was driving the Insurance supplied rent a car down the freeway when I saw one of the Nissan Crew Cabs in that horrid yellow color  The color caught my eye  and I decided to stop and give it a look Like the old Bugs Bunny cartoons  the car looked diminutive from the outside but seemed very roomy and comfy on the inside I even got out of the car a few times to see if the inside really looked bigger than the outside   months later it still looks this way to me Then I closed the door to see how the car felt THERE WAS SILENCE Not silence like you get when you are out at a BBQ on a summer evening  but silence like you get from inside a bank vault In fact  the Nissan proved to be the only truck I tested which required a Tachometer so that you do not forget and try to start the motor when it is already running   that quiet  really Next I took the little truck for a drive  The power was surprising for a small truck  While I heard that the Dakota had more H P  The Nissan is about as fast 1 4 mile  and seems to pull harder  I drove a 5 speed version as I am allergic to automatic transmissions The next surprise was the handling   it does not handle like a truck at all  No roll in the turns  and it actually takes curvy roads easily  even while totally loaded down with my moto gear Compared to the Dakota or the S10  the Nissan seemed to drive smoother  ride quieter and higher  and clearly could hang in the turns toss a 4 door Dakota or a big GM into a 60MPH turn and you will know what I mean The backseat is nice for about 80  of its intended use I am 6  2 quot  and can fit in the back fine  but would not want to be back there for a 5 hour trip or anything   2 or 3 would be ok For a child or two and a dog  the backseat is more than enough  Its also nice to have a place in the pickup to put stuff you do not want stolen or melted   cannot remember how many things I  lost  behind the seats of my regular cab Chevy The A C system is fine  but it has one speed  I don t mind  but those spoiled people with too much money may want for a  HIGH  setting Whats nice about the A C is that when you drive with a 5 speed you do not notice the A C like you do on the Chevys or Fords  Even the big GM V8 s had a noticable lag when the A C pump comes on  The Nissan makes the A C load barely noticable and has no measurable effect on your CITY mileage The bed is short  Nissan was nice enough to make a bed extender standard with many models  If you do not get a bed extender do not worry For things like motorcycles you do not want the extender anyhow  and its useless with materials like dirt or gravel The bed is as solid as my Chevy and a bit better connected to the frame  It also has wayyy more places for tie downs  To contrast  the new Full size 2000 Fords still have the best and most numerous tie downs of any pickup bed   then Dodge and then Nissan You can carry large stuff in the bed without problems  but you have to remember to tie down the rear of the material s  if you do not use the bed extender My truck came with a roof rack  step bumpers  and more  It MORE than makes up for the space lost in the bed when you can put 120Lbs  on the roof in a large tube metal roof rack At first I missed the  big iron  feel of my old Chevy  But the Nissan gets better mileage  had less maintenance  AND CAN TOW MORE WEIGHT Yep  My Chevy would groan on hills with a full bed and the camping trailer  Now I have that much stuff and two MORE people and the Nissan will climb hills in 5Th gear with a head wind The Nissan choices for car stereos suck worse than a black hole  Get the wrose stereo they have and throw it out and get a new one from anyone other than Nissan  Even the Bose system  2000 option  is not on par with a  600 Alpine or Pioneer  Paper speakers and poor placement only make the car sound worse My car came with the full car alarm  You can imagine I got this due to the car theft  It works fine  but is not stellar in any way either If you need a truck you can depend on  which will take the beating like a GM  but cost less to maintain  fuel  and repair  then I highly recommend the Nissan Crew Cab  If you like the outdoors or live in the snow  get the additional 4WD option and you are ready for death matches with Mad Max Do not buy this truck if you are one of those  kill the environment because I have more money than brains and do not care if I have a 14 foot car which gets 8 MPG  That is what the Suburbans and Excursions are for  This is not the best for a Construction contractor  but a plumbing or electrical contractor will find the truck has enough space for your stuff and your employees P S  When I bought the car  Nissan was NOT helpful in getting me the setup I wanted  I had to  settle  on a car which did not have all the feaures or the paint color I wanted The Austin Texas Nissan dealers have also proven to be as bright as a wet match stick Nissan has a 5yr 100KMile warranty they do not talk about  I recommend it highly   about  1500 br br  
 I honestly can t complain about the engine or transmission or any other major component of my 1997 Taurus GL  It has always gotten me where I need to go and has always started up in the morning  etc  However  about 2 000 miles after my 36 000 mile warranty expired  all sorts of things started to go awry  First  the passenger side window  automatic  of course  stopped rolling down  The driver s side went soon after that  And  now  none of my windows roll down  When you get into the car  the little light showing that a door is ajar remains on along with the dome light and all other interior lights  It s quite embarrassing driving down the highway at night with your car lit up like Times Square The parts  from what we have discovered  are only available through Ford  which means big money  So  my husband messed with it until he got a couple of the windows working  I m still waiting for the dome light to go out or the battery to run down first  I m anxious to trade this baby in before anything else happens br br  
 My husband and I bought a Saturn SL2 right before we got married in 1994 and we still have it  We highly recommend this car to all of our friends and a few of them have even bought one for themselves  It is a highly reliable car and we have only had to do routine maintenance on the car  When we first started looking at new cars we loved the friendly unpressured sales staff at the Saturn dealership  They told us what we all about the car and then left us alone to check the car out  They weren t constantly looking over our shoulder  We love the spacious cargo space  the comfortable seats  and just about everything else  The car is a dream to drive and is very easy to handle  I would recommend this car to any one who is looking for a little more space than a compact car and is in need of a very reliable car     
 Should a Woman purchase this size vehicle My wife needed a new vehicle for work   In our family there is my wife and 2 dogs only  At time of the purchase  she had a Ford Thunderbird  1994  She spends approximately 30 minutes driving 35 miles on an interstate one way to work daily  We live in Northeastern Ohio  the snow belt area  where weather can change quickly without warning I wanted to find a vehicle that I would feel comfortable with her driving in the good and bad weather  My wife does not miss work  We visited GM and Dodge and drove sport utilities from each  We brought a Ford Explorer home for a night  I did not feel safe in the vehicle when I corner hard as I drove the car in my normal manner on local roads After keeping the Explorer for a day  we returned it and I eyed the Expedition on the lot  I told our salesman that I would like to drive it  I told him I was not interested in the Explorer  Of course he said OK and we took it for a ride  My wife liked the way it drove and said she felt she was in total control within 5 minutes of her test drive  She liked the vehicle very much  The vehicle has automatic 4 wheel drive  Her comment was   quot look  I never have to worry about when to use it or not quot I told her the Explorer would not get the fuel mileage we got in the Thunderbird  and this would even get less  I also told her that it did not become safer in the snow going down the freeway at 65 miles an hour  it would take a lot more distance to stop and on ice  it would slide just like a car  but with more weight and distance required to stop or get it under control   My wife has completed donuts on the freeway before  but she has never had an accident  I wish I could say that  No more did this leave my mouth and deer ran out of the woods in front of us  She hit the brakes  changed the direction  moved around the deer and said quot it handles like a car quot I was nervous about the size of the vehicle and her comment was it is no larger then my F150  Experience at this point has taught me to shout up and I did There is a great deal of options that I would not order such as leather interior  heated seats  third seat but she liked how it handled from her test drive  Again  I relied on my experience to say  quot OK quot I suggest anyone that has a member of their family traveling any distance as my wife does  will feel comfortable with the vehicle from a safety point of view  The vehicle provides a great deal of protection in the frame and structure of the vehicle  You pay for this protection in the initial vehicle price and constantly in fuel cost This vehicle is not cheap to purchase or operate  We have never had to take it for anything but normal service  oil changes  The Eddie Bower has options which can break and put your vehicle out of service  it has not happened to us at this point  one year of ownership  The 4 wheel drive gives my wife a comfort that only 4 wheel drive can give  She handles the vehicle as a normal size vehicle  She has only owned or drove a Ford Thunderbird  Pontiac Firebird  Ferro  Monte Carlo and her first new car  a Ford Mustang I am allowed to drive when we go out with others  I fine the vehicle to be as safe  handles like it should  within the speed limit  and gets a solid 15 8 miles to a gallon of gas Expensive to purchase  Expensive to drive  compared to cars br br  
 I purchased a 1995 Ford Windstar in 1996 with close to 60 000 miles already on it  Having driven my 1987 Toyota Supra Turbo to the ground  had over 200 000 miles on it at trade in  and having made our first long  12 hour  road trip after having our first child  we decided it was time for a minivan  In terms of the positives  I love the way the Ford Windstar feels and handles on the road  and that s a pretty high compliment for someone who drove a turbo powered Supra  and I love how roomy it is  7 adults and luggage fit with no problem at all Now for the negatives   it wasn t long after I purchased the car  granted it was used  that it started to overheat  Went through several months of bringing it in and out of the shop  They finally ended up replacing the head gasket   OUCH  that was expensive  About 6 months after that  we got a recall notice in the mail about a problem with the engine  specifically its tendency to overheat and blow its head gasket  Consequently  I got reimbursed about 60  of all the repair expenses I had but still had to fork out a pretty penny I have just over 100 000 miles on the car right now and fortunately have not had any major repairs since the head gasket  However  there are all sorts of little things  odometer tends to get stuck  things rattle and squeak  etc  that could use repair because they are irritating My only other gripes about this car are related to the doors  For one  on the 1995 model there is the sliding door on only one side  Since when we first bought it  we ve had another child  To get two children into and out of carseats from one side of the car is a bit clumsy  The newer models all have sliding doors on both sides now  Secondly  the rear door is really heavy for some reason  It is hard to lift up and down easily  particularly when holding a child in your arms  The rear storage area is also not great for groceries  unless you have tons of stuff  since there is no way to keep things from sliding and rolling around I m sure this car won t last the 200 000  miles that my Toyota did  which is OK with me   I m looking forward to a newer minivan with more convenience features  I m neither passionately for or against this particular minivan   there are undoubtedly both better and worse  I won t say that my next one won t be another later model Ford Windstar  but I will definitely be checking out some of the other makes as well br br  
 We have a 1995 Golf III with 75 000  miles on it  The engine s holding up nicely but interior and cosmetic features have broken non stop since the car left its warranty period Let me give you a brief run down of everything that has gone wrong with the car between 1997 and 1999  The radio broke  The sunroof broke  The radio broke again  The driver side rear lamp has gone haywire  The power door look mechanism broke  The side molding fell off  The dash board lights are permanently out  The ignition wires needed to be replaced  The driver side rear lamp is still haywire  The side molding fell off again Aside from the above  other things have been replaced due to normal wear and tear  like the brakes and clutch  But this is to be expected  As you can tell  most of the above items are merely cosmetic and do not impact the longevity of the car but they do make owning the car a little less enjoyable  It seems that maybe there is something wrong with the car s electrical system  hence all of the radio and lighting problems The dealership and VW of America could not explain why the door locks broke  it made no sense to anyone  What is frustrating is that the car s gas tank door locked and remained locked because of the power lock failure  The dealership had to push the gas tank door in a little so that it could be opened and it still remains indented The car still drives well and the engine appears to be bullet proof so it is a good commuter car we re just starting to wonder how much longer we can expect it to last br br  
 I bought my new ranger xlt supercab 4drs flairside 4wd on 11 11 00  My truck came equipped with power  a c  slider  off rd pkg  premium stereo  fog lights  tow pkg  comes with 4wd  cruise  and much more  Im a former 96 4wd ranger owner  and was pleased with the performance of that vehicle so I decided to upgrade  My truck was equipped with the 3 0 liter 150 horsepower engine  It is geared low  and but is quite smooth  Being a 5 speed automatic it does down shift alot but comes with an overdrive switch  I recieve about 16 mpg on avg  The engine noise is not intrusive and Ford added alot of extra insulation to keep out noise in the 2001 model  They also improved the handling and braking  Abs is now standard  This truck does excellent off road  the ground clearance for the off rd pkg is one of the best in its class  The 4wd on demand is a great feature and works very smoothly  The interior has not changed much  the seats received a better contour and more space compartments were added in 98  My truck did come with some minor defects  1 scratch  rear pass  dr not catching firmly at top  and some small stone chips in windshield  The door will have to be fixed but the rest really is minor and I ll have to deal with it  Ford gives you alot for your money  the same equipped toyota  s 10  nissan  would have been about 3k more  I almost bought a new 2001 nissan but they were about 2k more  Complaint  The rear seats should have been redesigned to match the toyota tacoma  and to be able to handle a booster seat  Ford needs to improve the 3 0 liter put a 3 3L dohc 24v 200hpr  Ford did well with the face lift  The new look and re shaped hood is a nice feature  Ford looks to do a complete remodel in 2003 with a wider platform   most likely a complete 4 dr  I would rate this truck a B  in its class  I would suggest the 4 0 l that was added this yr   Read follow up comments  Alittle more Info or clarification  Post a questions and I will Respond  If I can help before you buy  let me know br br  
 I own a 1994 Ford Taurus  granted I should have done some more research  but I didn t  It was purchased in 1996  so it was only a couple of years old  fairly low miles  and I had seen the blitz about how safe the car is  It s a family mobile  you can even window lock the car so the kids can t roll down the windows  nice touch  The car is a V 6  but sure doesn t act like one  it s pretty slow getting started  but at least the ride is smooth Here are things that they don t tell you  and it cost me dearly  My car started to have trouble getting into reverse  it was idle there for a bit  then literally  quot kick quot  into gear  it s scary  it feels like the car is shaking apart  Then it started to do that when I put into drive  sometimes it would stall as well  I was getting really worried  so I go online and start checking my problems  It seems there is a manufacturing problem with certain years of the Taurus  Some of the parts are made out of aluminum  when it should have been made out of steel  There were even some lawsuits involved  and Ford of Canada noted this as a problem and agreed to fix some of those cars  This  of course  does not apply to Ford of America  In fact when I called  they told me there will be no financial help for a deficiency in their part  So what was the resolution  Let s just say it cost me about 5 month worth of rent  I had to have a rebuilt transmission  If I had gotten a new transmission  I could be in the same boat again  it really wasn t worth the time  or the effort  I don t know  maybe I am a bit bitter  but I ll never buy Ford again  especially for the fact that it is a known problem  yet they do nothing about it br br  
 Spending more time in California  I felt that I really needed to take the plunge to buy a convertible to totally appreciate the wonderful California sun  I began my search looking at BMW  Mercedes  and even a Corvette  All of them seemed to be missing something  I then looked at the Lexus SC430  I immediately fell in love with it as soon as I saw it  Before I even sat down in the driver s seat I was blown away by the artistic lines of this car  Not only did I quickly decide that this was the best convertible on today s market  but I have concluded it is the best car on today s market I have previously owned a BMW Z3  while I did love this car  the Lexus is leaps ahead of it  One of the most impressive features of the Lexus is the lack of road noise that is almost a constant present in all convertibles  In the Lexus  the wind noise magically disappears  This is a very impressive piece of engineering  That leaves me to enjoy the totally astounding sound system  There is no car sound system that comes close to the one on this Lexus  I have to admit that during the course of my many driving adventures I have had my fair share of driving mishaps  I have been lost in strange cities and rural areas more times then I would like to admit  That is why I love the GPS navigational systems that more and more auto makers are including on cars these days  On the Lexus  it is an option that is well worth the price  It has saved me a lot of time many times  Especially in California where I am still getting used to all the different areas of Los Angeles  Also  curing some of my other traveling adventures is the run flat tires that is part of the navigational option package  I am always having flat tires  I usually end up either calling the roadside assistance people or waiting for someone cute to come by a change my tire  Although  I have yet to have use the run flat feature  I feel very safe knowing that it is there  Which leaves me to concentrate on more important things   primarily myself  Who could be more important The only negative thing I can think of Well the back seat couldnt hold anyone for a long ride I am sure of it  who would even want to try  So my fan club will just have to arrange their own transportation  I give the Lexus SC430 a resounding five stars and recommend it to everyone   it is well worth every penny  
 I am  still  the proud owner of a 1999 Ford Escort ZX2  I was forced to sell the lease of a car  which I had come to adore  because of relocating from a lower southern state to a very northern one  I was definitely not a happy camper  When it comes to the big ticket items  I am extremely hard to please  I must have test drove at least a dozen cars  and each dealership was promising me the moon  My family and I would get excited just as the salesman handed us over to management who was very sorry  but that car is just a little out of your price range  Then the pitch to help me out by selling me a used up  used car at a great price followed  At the time I was forced to rely on public transportation  I do not have any ill thoughts towards riding the bus  but I found that their schedule did not always match mine  I was at my rope s end  when we pulled into the Ford dealership  I had resigned myself to lower my standards and to accept the first automobile they presented in my price range I walked into the dealership and walked right up to the first suit and tie I laid eyes on  Out of frustration and car lot abuse  I looked this total stranger in the eye and strongly stated who I was  as I shoved my hand into his and shook it up and down with quite a bit of force  This well dressed gentleman opened his mouth to speak  but I raised my hand to shush him  and informed him of what I wanted how I wanted it and exactly to the penny what I was willing to pay for it  There was laughter behind me and I reeled around to give them the low down on how people just like them push the gentle trusting souls  like me  over the edge  beyond civility  The man  now behind me  tapped me on the shoulder and whispered in my ear  quot I am only a customer  but  if this were my dealership  with your attitude  I would highly recommend the Ford Escort quot  I am sure my face deepened to the color of roses  as I timidly approached the sales counter and looked the girl  who had laughed at me  in the eye  and stated  quot And I do believe that a Ford Escort should be satisfactory quot  I did drive away that very day in my spanking new  1999 Ford Escort ZX2  The color was right  and the trunk was enormous  It was a two door  economy that felt like a luxury model  The price may not have been right  but my Ford dealer worked his magic numbers  and gave me and my family a very happy ending  Thank you Ford  and thank you nice man in the suit and tie     
 I purchased a  95 Contour GL in Aug of  97 for  9000  It had only 29k kiles on it  It had the 2 0 four cylinder and 5 speed  Before the warranty expired  the deal replaced free the rack and pinion steering syste  the A C blower  condenser and evaporator  and did some recall service  It was already a lemon under warranty  The cup holder broke kwik  the headlight plastic lense turned dark yellow  deminishing light output  The alternator failed  I had to replace the battery twice  and the alternator was very very hard to remove and replace  My mechanic friend replaced it and ins not a good sign when a pro complains about your car  The throw out bearing in the tranny was about to go out at 63k miles when I sold the car in Feb of  00  The car had bad resale value The only good thing was that my MPG never dropped below 23MPG in the city  I routinly averaged 30 31mpg on long out of town trips  and the seats and fron leg room was comfortable   I m 6 00  with long arms and legs The back seat was very small  Everyone complained  Handling was bad too  I replaced the tires with some Michelin Roadhandler Sports from Sears and made a huge differance in cornering  Excellent tires can make up for a bad car  It has horrible breaks  They fade very quickly  If you want a cheap car that breaks a lot and has no resale value buy the Contour  If you want a cheap car that is dependable and has decent resale value  buy a 95 altima from nissan  
 Yes we did buy this car knowing that it had 23 000 miles on it from being used as a Hertz rental car  and considering that fact it has held up very well  Appearance What I like best about the Taurus is the exterior styling  Looking at the car from the side gives the impression of a seamless flowing line  It may be a bit outrageous but it looks great with the 5 spoke alloy wheels and Willow Green paint  Some people don t like the new look  but I m tired of all sedans looking like they come out of a cookie press  This is a car that dares to be different and does so elegantly Performance The standard 3 0 liter Vulcan V 6 engine is no hot rod  and the jerky shifts that the automatic transmission makes doesn t make the engine s job any easier  However  the engine is adequate and provides enough response for most all situations  Handling in the Taurus is above average for a large car  The steering is very responsive  and the suspension does a good job of keeping the car pinned down  The ride should be a little better though  The suspension is supple but some larger bumps tend to upset it  and makes a lot of noise going over the rough stuff  The brakes should be great they are four wheel disc with ABS  but under repeated hard breaking the steering wheel and brake pedal vibrate Interior The interior is very nicely finished and the dash has a good quality look and feel to it  I especially like the integrated pod in the center of the dash where stereo and climate controls are located  The controls are easy to reach and have a quality feel to them  The front seats are well shaped  and the back seat is high  roomy  and comfortable  Road  wind  and engine noise are never intrusive  The trunk is very large  but shallow  The cruise control works well and de activates with the slightest touch of the brake pedal  Reliability Mechanical reliability has been great  The Vulcan 3 0 liter V 6 has been around for a long time and has proven itself reliable  There was a problem with a back window that refused to go down  a driver and rear door lock that refused to unlock by the power locks  and one recall for the engine temperature gauge  However  other than that the car is reliable and made a great replacement for the 1988 Ford Taurus we had owned before     
 The Ford Mustang tradition continues into the next millenium  The Ford Mustang appeals to the young and old alike ensuring a automotive legacy for itself  The new Mustang design is a product of aerodynamic and automotive research  Its design takes advantage of modern technologies and theories to provide maximum performance  Yet  it maintains the sporty and sleek appeal of a high performance vehicle that is part of the Ford Mustang tradition  The interior is a combination of colors and technological instrumentation that provides comfort and is very appealing to the eye This high performance car is very affordable  This allows accessibility for just about any consumer  Engine performance of both the six and eight cylinder models rate superior  The Mustang requires just the standard preventive maintenance measures to keep it in peek operating condition  The Mustang offers little room in the rear seat  When the front seats are adjusted for comfort the leg space is limited  Two or more individuals in the rear must sit closely together  This may appeal to a young couple  but can be very annoying for children The Mustang handles well over normal road conditions  In wet weather the rear of the Mustang may slide around curves at even normal speeds  The rear of the Mustang is very light  Placing some weight in the rear trunk compartment can alleviate this tremendously The Mustang suffers from some electronic problems that seem to be associated with most Ford vehicles  This involves mostly the computer sensor system  The check engine light remains illuminated even with no mechanical problems  The check seat belt light may remain illuminated even when all doors are secured and the passengers belted  Regardless of some minor problems the Ford Mustang is still an exceptional high performance vehicle at a economical cost Driving the Ford Mustang    
 I used to own a 92 Taurus wagon but with my growing family it was time for a change and the Lumina had what i was looking for The Lumina is an odd looking vehicle but it has get up and go when you need it The seven bucket seats that come out so easily when you need space is a major plus because you can customize it to suit your needs It did take some time to get used to the huge windshield but now it a breeze My van is pretty much plainjane no toys but rear heat and air with privacy glass   but that s all I need The 3 4 litre plants the power to the pavement right when you ask for it no delays  It has great fuel consumption but it costs me a few bucks at fill up time with a huge tank but that s ok because i love to drive it everywhere I was greatly surprised how well it goes through the snow in northern Ontario as long as you have a set of all season tires you are fine At highway speeds it cruises like a dream passing anything in its way but i would like a little more HP but 180 isn t to bad for a minivan I would recommend this van to anybody with a family or even just a couple looking for the perfect cross country traveller But i wouldn t trade it for anything now br br  
 I just got finished with my road test with the Ford Explorer Sport  I am very impressed with this vehicle  and the advancements that Ford Motor Company has put into this vehicle  I drove the Explorer Sport for 3 days  but that was enough time for me to make an acurate rating  I put just over 700 miles on the Explorer in these 3 days  Needless to say  I throughly enjoyed the time I got to spend with the Explorer Sport  Amongst all of the major revisions over the past few years that Ford has put into the Explorer the following are certainly my favorites  These revisions include a whole new front facia  which is shared with the Explorer Sport Trac  an upgraded suspension  and more standard creature comforts than ever before  Ford now has a standard 4 0L V 6 that produces an impressive 205hp 5 250rpm  and 240 lb ft of torque at 3 750rpm  Backing up the high powered V 6  is either Ford s 5R55E five speed automatic  or the five speed manual transmission  Stopping power is provided by new  massive 12 inch rotors  and stiffer calipers than the previous models had  while the 4 wheel ABS remains standard  The standard rear gearing is 3 73  while an optional 4 10 is also available  Alloy wheels and upgraded tires is standard on both 4x2 and 4x4 models  Other enhancements include a standard CD Player  a unique center console with a removable soft pack improved ride and handling  more front legroom  and an overall quiter interior  Another great added feature for 2001  is the white faced gauge cluster  It s easy to read  and easy on one s eyes in daylight and night time hours both  There s not really anything I did not like about the  quot all new quot  Ford Explorer Sport  Everything about the vehicle has been improved  The most obvious of the changes is the all new front facia and sheetmetal  which includes a new grille  headlights  and a new front bumper  which houses twin driving lights  For improved ride and handling  Ford has revised the suspension with new  longer  two stage variable rated tapered leaf springs in the rear and new shocks at each corner  I would certainly recommend this vehicle to anyone  because it seems like it has the capability of fitting anyone  I just got finished with my road test with the Ford Explorer Sport  I am very impressed with this vehicle  and the advancements that Ford Motor Company has put into this vehicle  I drove the Explorer Sport for 3 days  but that was enough time for me to make an acurate rating  I put just over 700 miles on the Explorer in these 3 days  Needless to say  I throughly enjoyed the time I got to spend with the Explorer Sport  Amongst all of the major revisions over the past few years that Ford has put into the Explorer the following are certainly my favorites  These revisions include a whole new front facia  which is shared with the Explorer Sport Trac  an upgraded suspension  and more standard creature comforts than ever before  Ford now has a standard 4 0L V 6 that produces an impressive 205hp 5 250rpm  and 240 lb ft of torque at 3 750rpm  Backing up the high powered V 6  is either Ford s 5R55E five speed automatic  or the five speed manual transmission  Stopping power is provided by new  massive 12 inch rotors  and stiffer calipers than the previous models had  while the 4 wheel ABS remains standard  The standard rear gearing is 3 73  while an optional 4 10 is also available  Alloy wheels and upgraded tires is standard on both 4x2 and 4x4 models  Other enhancements include a standard CD Player  a unique center console with a removable soft pack improved ride and handling  more front legroom  and an overall quiter interior  Another great added feature for 2001  is the white faced gauge cluster  It s easy to read  and easy on one s eyes in daylight and night time hours both  There s not really anything I did not like about the  quot all new quot  Ford Explorer Sport  Everything about the vehicle has been improved  The most obvious of the changes is the all new front facia and sheetmetal  which includes a new grille  headlights  and a new front bumper  which houses twin driving lights  For improved ride and handling  Ford has revised the suspension with new  longer  two stage variable rated tapered leaf springs in the rear and new shocks at each corner  I would certainly recommend this vehicle to anyone  because it seems like it has the capability of fitting anyone br br  
 I started to lease my Ranger in July of this year   99  I love the look of my truck  It s green with the grey wheel well covers and the chrome front and back bumpers  It has the 4 door option  not 4 full doors though  but they come in handy when you have more than 3 people in your truck  I ve had it in the mud only three times  and it s great to have if ya  like to go muddin   It s nothing spectacular though  I replaced the stock cassette player with a JVC Kameleon CD player and the stock speakers actually don t sound that bad  It has a towing package which will come in handy in the winter time too  The only thing really wrong with my truck  well the 2 things wrong with my truck  is that it s a 3 0L V6 and it s bad on gas  Besides that  it s a nice truck  I ve had many compliments on it and I ve had many people look inside and around it   It s fun to watch them walk up to your truck and then set off the panic button  or lock the doors and make it honk  If your looking for a dependable truck with good looks  great history  and loads of fun  you should try a Ford Ranger on for size  I drive mine back and forth from Argos  IN to South Bend  IN twice a week  Very dependable br br  
 The Chevy has come along way in the past ten years  from the 1990 model that had a boxy look and a defective paint job  Today s Blazer is sleek and stylish  The interior is comfortable with plenty of room both in the front and the back as well as cargo room  Since this model is small than some of the other midsize SUVs it has easy handling as well as ample acceleration  It s 4WD option makes it an ideal tool in winter driving  The price ranges from quite affordable to a bit expensive  The blazer is comparable to the GMC Jimmy and the Ford Explorer  Although I d pick the Blazer over the Jimmy any day it s a close call between the Blazer and the Explorer  If you want basically the same car and save a bit more  you might tend toward the Explorer  Either way  the Blazer is a truly remarkable vehicle for the price     
 I recently purchased a 2001 Kia Soprtage back in June of 2001  My wife  2 kids and I had shopped all of the usual car dealers looking for a second car with a little more room than the present car we have  We looked and looked  What it finally came down to was what we could afford  We narrowed it down and the one that came out of the pack was the Kia Sportage  We got the basic model with a few options to sport it up a bit  We opted for a CD player  Rear wiper  Roof rack  Keyless entry  and Alloy wheels  The Sportage comes with many  many standard features  Some of these features include  Power locks  steering  windows  mirrors  Tilt Steering wheel  Digital Clock  AM FM stereo  Cup Holders front and rear  and too many more to mention  One of Kia s  sticks  is that there are so many standard features than any other car or SUV on the market  You know what they are right  Not may cars come standard with all of this stuff  especially power everything  and a radio  Here are some specs of the Kia Sportage that I looked at before I bought it   Dimensions b Wheelbase   104 3 inches Length   162 5 inches Width   68 1 inches Height   65 0 inches Front headroom   39 6 inches Front legroom   44 5 inches Rear headroom   37 8 inches Read leg room   31 1 inches Cargo  rear seat up   25 8 cubic feet Cargo  rear seat down   55 4 cubic feet B Capacities B Fuel   15 8 Gal Towing   1 000lbs Payload   860lbs B Safety B Driver Side air bag and knee bag Passenger side air bag Side impact beams in the doors Child Safety read door locks Rear seat child seat tether anchors High adjustable seat belt anchors B Engine B Inline 4 cylinder  iron block  aluminum head DOHC  16 valves 130 HP at 5 500 rpm 5 speed manual transmission  overdrive I was impressed with the features on this SUV  I test drove it and it had some pep  but not a whole lot  but there was enough power when you had to use it  There seemed to be more get up and go in the manual transmission than in the automatic  I did notice that it shifted smooth and flawless  The clutch was easy to press down and operate  The dashboard is laid out in a nice plan  The air heat is right there in the center with temp control and fan speed  Right above that are 2 big vents for the air heat  Below the vents is the cup holder  Press once and it slides out with 2 holders  press back in and it locks  There is also a digital clock  Below the air heat controls is the radio  We upgraded to a CD player  Nice stereo  6 speaker system  with base  treble  balance  and front back control  The CD player played nice  No skipping or jumping  even while riding on a bumpy road  There is also a center island with a storage compartment and an armrest that adjusts forward and back to fit your arm  The only problem is that once the cup holders are out you cannot see the temp controls for the air heat  The drivers seat is comfortable and roomy  I am 5 11  and had no problem with leg or headroom  The drivers side also has seat lumbar adjustment  footrest and tilt steering wheel adjustment  All of the window controls are on the driver s door  You may also lock out anyone else from rolling down there windows  Especially good when you have kids that love to touch every button and switch  The passenger side felt the same as the driver s side  Right in front of the seat is a glove compartment that has lots of room for all of your stuff  There is also a map holder in the visor on the passenger side and driver s side Now to the back seats  I was impressed with the amount of room in the back seats  It is a bench seat with high backs for comfort  The seats also fold down for more cargo room  There is an ashtray and cup holder on the center console  I have two children who both are still in car seats and I fit them easily in the back seat  There is plenty of room for another car seat if it is necessary  There are also 3 tether anchors on the floor of the cargo space in the back  With the seats in the upright position there is ample cargo space in the back of the vehicle  I will put it this way when my family and I went to Disney World and took 2 big suitcases and one little one  A double stroller  playpen and many other things and had plenty of room  The ride over there was comfortable and enjoyable  The car drives smooth  I did notice that when your speed gets to be over 70mph  a gust of wind will make the car move slightly  but it is not that bad The gas mileage for this car is very good  Through manual transmission it gets 20 city  23 highway  For automatic it gets 18 city  21 highway  I only have to fill up the tank once every week and a half  I travel 40 miles per day to and from work on a manual transmission  I have only had it in the shop 2 times  once to adjust the alignment and fix the back windows  the other time was for the 3000 mile oil change and tune up  Other than that I have not had any problems at all  The car is running just like new  The warranty is one of the best assets  It is 10 year or 100 000 mile limited powertrain warranty  It also includes a 5 year or 60 000 mile limited basic warranty  5 year or 100 000 mile limited anti perforation and a 5 year unlimited mile road side assistance plan  I was very impressed with all features of this SUV  I would recommend this to someone that wants a bigger car then the one that they have and is on a limited budget  There were only a few negative points that I have had with this car so far  I will be keeping this SUV for as long as it keeps running  
 I purchased my first Ford Explorer because I liked the way it looked and it gave me the ability to see well in traffic  I am now leasing my Explorers every two years and plan to continue doing so  I love the handling  the height which gives me the ability to see in traffic  the lights that come on automatically when needed  the side mirrors that light up when you unlock the door with the remote  and the power that can be called on to get me out of a tight spot  The only thing I don t like about an Explorer is the fact that many people are driving them and it can be very confusing when you return to a parking lot  I think anyone interested in comfort  dependability  a great handling would appreciate this car  Those people who are intimidated by a large vehicle should stay away  even though it is extremely easy to handle   
 If you are going to buy a SUV  the Ford Explorer seems to be the one to get  It is consistently rated the best and the price is pretty reasonable  I have no complaints to date  although I have only owned the car for one year  If you have a kid and need to put a car seat in the back  you will need to put the car seat on one of the sides  it does not appear to work in the middle  The truck seems to eat gas  but I think that is true with all these SUV s  The seats are comfortable  the handling is fine  the power is good  the trunk is large  All around  I am happy with the Ford Explorer  although I hate the car salesmen that sold the car to me  Enjoy br br  
 This review is not about the new style current Ranger   It is about an older version   a 1986 white one   Bare bones truck   It didn t even come with a radio since it was bought as a supposedly temporary work truck for the family business   It s a little 5 speed   No carpet in it   As I said   no original radio  it has one now     And guess what   This little truck is still our company truck   not to be gotten rid of until she literally goes belly up on us   It has well over 300 000 miles on it   It has been in at least 3 accidents in my memory   all minor thank goodness   It was backed over a street sign   It is used to haul all of the equipment for our phone service   The average weight she carries   7 days a week is about 500 750 pounds   It also has a large shell and carries 2 ladders as well   The only thing wrong with this truck after this long   The driver s side seat belt wore out and the stick shift needed a new handle   And this is without regular maintenance   I can t remember the last time the oil was changed   The shocks were finally replaced when we noticed that they had visually worn through the casings   If you can find a little truck as nice as this one   Buy It   You won t be sorry      
 BUICK KICKS OFF NEW MILLENIUM WITH A SPECIAL CENTURY Buick touts the Century as a family car  with the appeal and styling of a much more expensive sedan  In nearly six months of driving the Century 2000 Special Edition  the car continues to surprise and please us almost daily The ride  the interior  storage and accessories all have proven their quality and craftsmanship in the first few months of working the car into routine  First  let s consider the ride  With a large six cylinder engine  the Century demonstrates considerably more guts in acceleration that other autos its size  In sudden acceleration bursts  the vehicle surges ahead confidently  without hesitation  providing drivers with the confidence they need in congested highway driving  Overall the motor is quiet  though it does sound throaty when you punch on the accelerator at times  The Century s power plant seems ample for highway and city driving  Steering is crisp and responsive  And the wide frame provides a smooth  even ride While the engine provides plenty of power  the interior provides ample comfort  The glove like leather seats envelope passengers and provide enough legroom for a person 6  3  to sit comfortable   with room to spare  Understandably  the Century s back seat is tight when the front seats are pushed far back  But there is still enough room for children to sit comfortably  The six way power seats make it possible for tall drivers to sit without jarring their heads against the interior roof line  The interior s best feature is its seating  The leather seating is comfortable and plush  The dashboard stands out for its simplicity and its convenience to controls  Steering wheel mounted radio and CD player controls convenient enable the driver to adjust controls without taking hands off the steering wheel  The radio plays well  with little static if any  and the CD player provides a consistent sound with barely a skip  The dashboard controls are easily within reach and conveniently laid out The dual temperature controls work well   enabling a front seat passenger to warm up or cool air flow through the ducts on that sight of the car  The automatic thermostat works fine  if comes on when the sensor determines the temperature has shifted from the programmed setting  The air conditioning is responsive  cooling a hot interior in Florida within a few minutes  and providing almost immediate relief to front seat passengers One downside is the automation and sensors on the vehicle  While the lighting works just fine  it s easy to forget to turn on your headlights   though they ll come on automatically at the onset of darkness  The keyless entry can be optionally programmed  but the default enables driver and passengers to leave the vehicle at night with the lights on for 90 seconds   a nice feature in a dark area On the upside  the rear split fold seats make it convenient to reach into the trunk during a long trip and access a cooler or other belongings  And  speaking on the trunk  it s huge  You can easily fit four medium suitcases and two large golf bags into that cavernous space The Buick Century 2000 Special Edition has exceeded our expectations  and provides a fine family vehicle for local and long distance driving 30 br br  
 I went in to my purchase of a new 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo  2WD  looking for a 2003  and the dealer just happened to have this one on the lot and wanted to move it quickly  Though I ve never driven a Jeep before  I m happy I bought what I did The overall styling is admittedly what first drew my attention to the JGC  The  04 carries forward the same basic design lines of the  03  with a few superficial changes  most notably to the grill  Whereas the  03 s wore a bright gleaming silver grill  the  04 sports a matte platinum color  which I think feels a little refined  Of course 2004 brings the intro of the new Freedom trimline  with a body color painted grill and a center platinum colored bar in the front bumper  if you prefer something newer I m happy to report that the JGC handles very nimbly  I was surprised to find it has a reasonably tight turning radius  making it easy to maneuver in and out of slim parking spaces  The standard V6 has plenty of pickup  and is pretty quiet through all but the most pedal to the metal acceleration  Overall  you get a fairly smooth ride even over moderately bumpy streets  although if you hit a lot of pot holes over 35 40 miles an hour  you may feel a little like you re bouncing along the back country in a pickup  It s fair to say that this Jeep feels pretty agile  responding in a way more car like than anything else  with sort of a hybrid ruggedized luxury minivan feel  If you re into high speed sports car ish cornering and performance than maybe an SUV isn t for you  But sitting up high  you re in command of the road  and this vehicle is anything but sluggish or lumbering The interior complements the refined exterior  Dials and gauges are bright and easy to read  laid out simply and straightforward  Controls are within easy reach  and the tilt steering wheel makes it easy for tall folks to get in and out without feeling like a sardine  Mine came with a power driver s seat  which may have just a little TOO many adjustment options  but does allow just the right fit between driver  seat  pedals and steering wheel  Also highly recommended is the power package  After four years driving a car without power  I m appreciative every day for the power locks  window and fold away mirrors  hint  throw in the keyless entry while you re at it  since the sole keyed lock on the driver s door could make it inconvenient to be without The rear seats fold flat  giving up lots of room for cargo if needed  The rear lift gate lifts high up and out of the way for easy rear loading  and flipper window glass in the liftgate can be opened separately  for easy access to smaller loads  I ponied up  75 for a cargo cover  which quickly converts the open rear to a sort of trunk  good for keeping your belongings securely out of view from prying eyes  the rear tinted glass helps with that too  and shades out the sun without compromising visibility  I also opted to lightly tint the two front windows With some convenience group or another came the overhead mini trip computer display  I honestly could live without it  but there s nothing wrong with having it  On the upside you can use it as a secondary tripometer  which counts not only your miles but also time  and it ll let you know how much longer until you re due for an oil change or a gas up  as well as your average mileage  and if and when that gets depressing  you can always switch it to either compass outside temperature mode  or off  Honestly  the  04 Jeep  talking about the V6 2WD  isn t an econobox gas miser  but hopefully it won t drain Iraq of oil in a week either  I find that on average  in stop and go city suburban traffic  and this is Texas  so yes  I keep the A C running on full most of the time  it ll get around 16 mpg  probably less if you re a lead foot  Surprisingly though  take it onto the freeway and at cruising speed I ve been able to crank out upwards of 25 26 mpg  That s not too shabby compared to the Neon I used to drive  which maxed out at around 30 mpg hwy  In all  the 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a comfy  sturdy  stylish ride  A few amenities thrown in will sweeten the deal  As it s brand new  I can t speak yet for reliability  although the standard warranty  3yrs 36k miles bumper bumper  7yrs 70k miles power train  makes me feel fairly confident that it shouldn t suffer a major breakdown  For peace of mind  I invested  1900 in the extended warranty  which added 4 years and 30k miles to my bumper bumper coverage  for a grand total of 7yrs 100k miles worry free  That ll outlast my payments by two years  and that makes me happy  
 I have just purchased a  96 Camry XLE and I love it  It has all of the qualities of a luxury car without the cost  I was able to get a sunroof  leather seats  alloy wheels  CD player  and the gold package for under 16 000  The car only had 45 000 miles on it and it runs great  A year ago I purchased a  92 Camry LE and it still runs great with 118 000 miles on it  I still own both cars and will stay with Toyota because they seem to offer great cars and quality cars  The only trouble I have had is with the valve seals  When they go bad the car smokes on start up and looks like you are burning oil  The parts aren t expensive its just the labor to replace them that is br br  
   ANNOUNCER LLLLLADIES AND GENTLEMEN  Welcome to this evening s main event  In this contest  the  Ford Mustang  and the  Chevrolet Camaro  will square off in the Detroit Battle of the Pony Cars  Who will be our champion b BOB  I m not gonna sugar coat this one  Chuck  This should be the toughest comparison we have seen yet CHUCK  Absolutely  Bob  This place is sold out and ready to watch this age old classic war rage on  In many ways  I see it more as a grudge match  because rumors are floating around that the Camaro and the Firebird might be ceasing production soon due to decreasing sales  BOB  The rumor s been around a long time  let s hope it s not true this time around  If it is  that s really too bad  General Motors  if you re watching  we d be mad at you CHUCK  Take it easy  Bob  Let s get started b EXTERIOR  Chevy Camaro b BOB  Personally  we feel that the Chevy Camaro just looks the part of a muscle car better  especially its higher trim levels  This is not to say we don t find the Mustang attractive  Quite the contrary  CHUCK  And we would hardly consider the Camaro s exterior to be more user friendly than the Mustang  But you want a muscle car to look  mean   and we feel the Camaro bares its teeth more than the Mustang does b INTERIOR  Ford Mustang b BOB  I can t say I m crazy about either interior  Both give me that nasty plasticky feeling  But in the end I would pick the Mustang  It has more passenger room  and more room in the back seat than the Camaro  The Camaro s sound system is far superior to the Mustang s in our opinion  but that s about it  You can t even see the front end of the Camaro  and the rear view mirrors are tiny  That would take some getting used to CHUCK  Yep  The Camaro just gave us an overall cramped feeling  I did  for one  like the dash of the Camaro better  however  The Mustang s is just as clean and functional but not as aesthetically pleasing  Still  the seats are just way too low on the Camaro  and getting in and out is a chore  To the Camaro s credit  I would say that Chevy succeeded in having the more  quot car enthusiast quot  interior  such drivers don t care about these trivialities  do they BOB  Call us wimps then  because we prefer the friendlier Mustang interior b ENGINE  Chevy Camaro b BOB  I gotta tell ya  Chuck  when it comes to the  quot most go for your dough quot  the Camaro has the Mustang s number  The 0 60 numbers are very close for the base engines  but we picked the Camaro s engine for its low rpm thrust  smoother delivery  and excellent response timing  Again  this was still a close call for us CHUCK  That s right  The Mustang s engine saw an incredible power boost for 1999  which narrowed the gap considerably between these two cars  The powerful Mustang GT received power gains too  up to 260hp  The base Camaro wouldn t stand a chance against the GT  but the 305hp Camaro Z28  direct competitor for the GT  would give it a swift spanking  Only the Mustang SVT Cobra can compete with the likes of the Z28  but then an SS would be a more appropriate comparison BOB  You know  had Ford not dropped its 5 0L V8 of old  it would fare much better in a competitive comparison  As far as our base model comparison  we feel that the comparison is closer than ever before  but the Camaro still comes out on top CHUCK  But let s not kid ourselves  even the Camaro SS  320hp  is only a  little  bit faster than the Mustang GT  according to Car  amp  Driver  it s only half a second faster in the quarter mile  When it comes to buying  I see the  4 200 advantage of the Mustang GT over the Camaro SS over any other stat  So you re right  Bob  When it comes down to money  this comparison is not quite as easy as it seems b RIDE  Ford Mustang b BOB  We found the ride of the Mustang to be more compliant than the Camaro  Its suspension was one of the major updates for 1999  the Camaro still uses its rather dated rear live axle suspension  The fact that it was noiser in the Camaro  road noise  tire noise  than in the Mustang didn t help things much  either CHUCK  I personally prefer the exhaust note of the Camaro s engine to the Mustang s  but that s really it  The Mustang just makes a better compromise between handling and ride quality b HANDLING  Chevy Camaro  in a nail biter b BOB  Yikes this comparison is tough so far CHUCK  I m with you  Bob   Every  category has been close BOB  Well  the Camaro came out on top in the handling category  Its tires hold well during moderate or even sharp turns  And since it is so low to the ground  you get almost no body lean at all  I liked how the Camaro practically anticipated our every move  CHUCK  But it wasn t as one sided as you would think  the Mustang s brakes were improved for 1999  and we felt that they were superior to the Camaro s during our test  Further research confirmed that the Mustang takes four less feet to stop from 60 0 than the Camaro does  In addition  I think the Mustang has an edge in its steering  But not enough to win this round b RELIABILITY  TIE b BOB  Both reliabilities are listed as average  Dealers are both accessed easily  Neither one gains much ground on the other in customer satisfaction either CHUCK  And the warranties are essentially the same  minus a little discrepancy in corrosion coverage  not enough to get a winner here BOB  Wheeee  moving on b VALUE  Chevy Camaro b BOB  If what you want is rear wheel MUSCLE then the Camaro is the better value for you  It comes with many important standard features  such as ABS which is optional on the Mustang  In addition  it gives you stronger engine performance and an overall sportier  feel  let s say  And even though the Mustang closed the gap considerably by improving its power  we have to hand it to Chevrolet for providing us with the choice of the Camaro Z28  which is arguably one of the best sports car buys out there CHUCK  Bear in mind that  quot better value quot  does not necessarily mean  quot better car quot  or  quot smarter buy quot  The Mustang GT package  for example  comes in with more features than the Camaro Z28  and even a smidgen cheaper  But it still has 45 fewer horses than the Z28  which is a significant edge in favor of the Camaro b WINNER  FORD MUSTANG  IN A SURPRISING DECISION b BOB  Now we ve really fallen off the rocker  The Camaro won by a vote of 4 2  and yet we still picked the Mustang as the winner  What s going on CHUCK  Simple  The Chevrolet Camaro performed better in our road test comparison  However   we felt that the Ford Mustang had a better  balance  of race track qualities and everday functionality than the Camaro  did  For all of you faithful Camaro worshippers  you should be happy with the outcome of our test because we assume that you could care less about everyday functionality  For you  we assume that it all comes down to the race track qualities  and believe us  the Camaro won t disappoint BOB  But our vote shouldn t come as much of a surprise  either  This is exactly the same kind of vote that is cast by the majority of your dollars  the Ford Mustang outsells the Camaro and Firebird twins  combined  by a margin of  2 to 1 i  And the fact that the Camaro and the Firebird are soon to be cut from production because of this only further accentuates our point CHUCK  So before you choose which of these two cars you prefer  take a good look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself what it is you want  Seriously  do it  we had to  Thanks for reading  That does it for us  Good night out there BOB  Join us next time for our next feature  AM General Hummer takes on a mule in the back country i Note  I drove both of the base models cars extensively for a period of two days  and therefore recognize that this comparison is better suited for decisions between those trims  Whether or not you found this review helpful entertaining  drop me a line i br br  
 I recently bought a 2001 VW Jetta GLX  galactic blue  with tan leather interior  Okay  this car just feels good  The first passenger I took out in the car said   This is a Volkswagen  I feel more like I m in a BMW  That s basically what I feel like driving this car everyday  and it usually puts a smile on my face that I paid in the mid 20s instead of the mid 30s for this awesome car  The handling is crisp and the acceleration is great  even on the automatic  Top speed seems to plateau out around 110  but I m sure I could get it up to 120 or so if I had enough road and no cops were around  The Monsoon sound system is absolutely great  but I haven t had the chance to use it with CDs yet considering the Jetta does not come with a CD player  You can get a factory installed in dash or 6 disc changer in the trunk  I ve done some searching and found that the Panasonic CX DP610 works with the VW radio and all controls  and it installs easily in the truck in like 10 minutes  You just need to buy a converter thingy and set up the mounting brackets   Check out www logjamelectronics com to get a good deal on this 6 disc trunk changer Let s see  what else  There really isn t much leg room in the back seats  but hey  I m not sitting back there  Passengers can be comfortable if I move my seat up a couple of inches  which does not hinder my driving ability at all  I m about 5 11  If you were much bigger  you d need to have the chair back all the way and anyone sitting behind you would be a little cramped The radio and climate controls are located a little bit low for my taste  There really isn t anywhere else they could go unless you removed the center A C blower  Also  there is a small slot where the in dash CD player would go that is located above the A C controls and the radio  The cup holders obstruct this slot when they re in use   The cup holders work well with any size cup or can because they are like a spring loaded claw that clamps down on the cup The trunk size is large enough to lay a set of golf clubs flat in the trunk or to hold maybe 20 25 grocery bags  It is kind of annoying that you have to physically lift the trunk after you unlatch it  It doesn t automatically pop up to the top position The auto darkening rear view window is great when you re driving on the highway at night and a big truck is behind you  Normally  you d be blinded but this great feature spares your eyes There is one gimmick feature on the GLX which I think is a complete waste  Supposedly  it has rain sensing wipers that speed up with more rain and slow down when the rain lightens up  To me  it seems that the wipers just randomly wipe without any connection to how much rain is collected on the windshield in front of me  They do automatically stop when the rain stops  so they must work a little bit  at least The main thing I love about this car is the appearance inside  The tan leather contrasting the black  rubber  dash makes the car just look phenomenal  The wood trim just adds to the look of this car  I ve found it well worth the price tag so far  and I just hope it holds up well for years to come  Oh  and they say you re supposed to use premium gas with the VR6 engine  With gas prices already high  I ve been alternating between regular and premium  If anyone knows any reason why I should NOT do this  please let me know  I don t want to kill my car  
 I do not believe highly in Ford vehicles or even the modern SUV craze  but I must say this is an exception  Not only does it have a turning radius better then my Sister s Honda  but it also rides smoother  It has less space then a Suburban in the rear  not to worry though it has the same towing capacity  The Expedition carries as many as eight people quite comfortably  The Expedition clearly takes higher rank on the mpg  It s acceleration is a bit slower and over all speed is slower  but why rush when you are sitting in comfortably cushioned seats that have adjustable lower back paddings and the normal adjustable movements  One minor problem is the exiting from the far back row  It is raised a little higher then the rest of the seats so it makes it a little more difficult to either walk over the seat in front of you or try and find the lever to fold the seat forward  So even though it may cost you a little more in gas than a sedan or compact  it will save you money in insurance and it is a car you wouldn t mind just cruisin  down PCH during a beautiful California sunset br br  
 If you want a smaller truck that can do it all a ford ranger might be your answer  The very first new vehicle I ever owned was a beautiful blue extra cab ranger  it was a 95 model  I wish that I had kept it  I loved it  but the family was growing and we needed more interior room  My husband works as a mechanic for our local ford dealership and he knows the vehicles that are the most dependable  the ranger is one of the best trucks on the market  my husband swears that he has only seen a couple rangers in the shop over the 5 year period that he has worked there  other than for routine maintenance  I owned mine for 2 1 2 years and I never had a problem with it  it rode great  very little wind noise  and the best part was that when we put it up for sale we actually got the same price that we had paid for it new after 2 1 2 years of driving it so obviously they hold their value If you are in the market for a truck I would suggest looking closely at the ranger  they are really nice  you can t go wrong br br  
 I purchased my J30 when it was two years old from an Infiniti dealer to take advantage of a great extended warranty program  6 years or 70K miles  The J30 is not your typical car  with it s rare styling you either love it or hate it  If you are looking for a typical four door people mover  move on  this is not the car for you  On the other hand if you are looking for a sedan with the qualities of a sports car  definitely take a look The J30 has a 3 liter engine lifted from the old Nissan 300ZX driving the rear wheels with plenty of power on tap  The car handles wonderfully and is also very quiet due to all the curved body panels The rear seat is best forgotten and only used in a pinch  While the seats are plenty comfortable  it is the legroom or lack there of that is the problem  In the driver s seat is where you want to spend your time  having a blast If you are considering the J30  it came in two trim lines  the base model and the J30t  touring model  The touring model simply gives you a stiffer suspension and a small spoiler on the trunk lid  which in my opinion breaks up the lines of the car  The J30 is a flowing  curved work of art  why put a speed bump on the trunk lid and ruin it  My advice  buy the base model because it has everything you need The car comes equipped  There were only three options  an integrated phone  spoiler  and mud flaps  Standard items include  leather  sunroof metal not glass  200 watt Bose with 6 speakers  CD  amp  tape  power mirrors with defrost  rear defrost  auto dimming mirror  auto climate  power seats  and remote entry  Infiniti even thought about little things like putting a first aid kit in a special compartment in the trunk I have always kept my car serviced at the Infiniti dealer and would recommend it to anyone  I have always been treated like I was the only customer in the world and they want me to be happy  loaner Infiniti s are also available while they have your car  Every time I have looked into it  the dealer prices were only slightly more for service  so they get my business because they know the car more than some Bubba at a corner shop Finally  on a sad note  the J30 is no longer imported  The car was sold in the US from 93 97  I plan on keeping my car around for many years to come  with regular service  hundreds of thousands of miles are possible  On closing  if you want a solidly built sports car with a back seat to use in a pinch  give the J a look     
 When we first had a baby  I was driving an Eclipse Spyder  Needless to say  this is not a baby car  As a matter of fact  I refuse to put my son in it  For a year  we managed to get by with one car that we could take our son around in  But  being an independent women  grin  I wanted to be able to leave the house when I was home alone with my son  which I couldn t do at this point  Why didn t I just keep the  baby  car  Well  mine was foreign  and my husband works at Ford you do the math  So  we needed a new car  I refused to be a minivan mom  no offense to those of you who are  I just don t like em  so we decided on an SUV  Being that my husband worked at Ford  he heard about the Escape long before it came out  And I wanted one  It was an Explorer  but smaller and cuter  That s a good combination considering I m small  and  well  cute   grin  But seriously  I liked the idea that it was an SUV that drove like a car  It was also supposed to be much safer  without the threat of rollovers that most SUV s are plagued with  So  we ordered one and after months of waiting  it came in  And it s beautiful  We got toreador red  which is a maroonish color  The interior is tan and black  The car is also available in yellow  yes  bright yellow  for you showoffs  red  a forest green  blue  black  white  and tan  I don t know the specific  Ford  names for all these colors  but that s what it breaks down to  Aside from the pleasing asthetic value of the Escape  it also drives great  If you are looking for a good off road vehicle  this is not the one you should be buying  But  the Escape wasn t made for offroaders  It was made for people who wanted the look of an SUV  with the control of a car  It s a little bumpier than a regular car  but the ride is smooth  It also corners very well  which I love  being used to a small convertible  The Escape is available in 2 Wheel Drive  or 4 Wheel Drive  We chose the 4WD variety  You can also get a four cylinder or six cylinder engine  Ours is six  According to the dealer  the four cylinder engines aren t selling as well  The Escape has some great standard features  Solar tint glass  Woo  How new millenium  power everything  roof rack  rear windshield wipers   flip and fold  rear seats  A C  anti lock brakes  and remote keyless entry  We also got side step bars  a power moonroof  and side airbags  Oh yea  did I mention that the CD player is standard  Nice  eh  All this  and a great price too  The base model runs around  18 000  Fully loaded  which ours is  is around  25 200  Not bad for an SUV  Gas mileage is a little better than standard SUV  City is 18 MPG and highway is 24 MPG  It s no car mileage  but still not bad  For all you mommies and daddies out there  the Escape also comes with three tether hookups for the backseats  This is a great feature to help keep your child s car seat secure  And our car seat fit very well  The backseats are relatively comfortable  and there is tons of legroom  Although it looks smaller than an Explorer  the didn t skimp on space  The rear area leaves plenty of room for numerous parcels or luggage  There is also a cover you can place over them to protect anything from flying french fries  Being a short person  I can t accurately judge the legroom in the driver s seat  but my husband  who is much taller than I am  had no problem fitting in the passenger seat  The car is very comfortable to drive  and I feel very safe with my child in the back  Ford has added a number of safety features to the Escape  making it a nice  reliable ride  It looks nice  drives well  and is priced affordably  For those parents out their looking for a good family vehicle  I highly recommend the Ford Escape  One warning  They are selling like hotcakes  so get one while you can  I believe there is quite a waiting list for orders  so if you are interested  call your dealer right away  
 I have a new used 1995 Volvo 960 that I absolutely adore  Several of my friends have Volvos and have been very pleased  Volvo is one of the most durable safe vehicles on the road today  When a friend of mine was in a car wreck last summer  being in a Volvo is literally what saved their lives  I love the style that will never go out of date also  The luxury of the leather  all electrical  sunroof  and smooth steering sold my husband and myself on the overall purchase of our Volvo  The 960 series was recommended for the added size and power which we love  Since we bought our car used  we did not have to pay the high price for a luxury car  yet we drive in style  I am sold 100  on the trusted name of Volvo and will continue to purchase Volvos in the future br br  
 I never thought I d be driving a minivan  A mustang convertible has always been my dream car and a minivan is about as far away from a Mustang as you can get  Or  so you d think  I am a huge fan of my 1999 Ford Windstar  This vehicle has some get up and go that I never expected it to have  It drives like a car  which was a switch from most of the minivans I had test driven  It rides smooth and the V6 engine gives you all the pick up that you ll need  We got our Minivan in June and planned on doing a lot of traveling with it  My family is spread across the country and plane tickets get really expensive   very quickly  So we knew that we needed something comfortable and reliable that had a little room to move around  This van has not disappointed us once in the 11 300 miles we ve driven it thus far  It s been to the tops of mountains  driven through snow  down into the heat of the deep south and it just keeps going  I love the way it handles and the comfort of it  I love the roominess and the ease with which the seats fold down and come out   Although they are quite heavy  I love the tinted rear windows and the separate temperature control system for the rear of the van  The one thing this van has that I never thought we d use that often is the cd player  Boy  was I wrong  I absolutely love being able to listen to cd s in the van  The other feature this van has that we love is 4 doors  It is wonderful to be able to access the back from both sides There are a few downsides to this van  One is the fact that ours did not come equipped with keyless remote  We had that on our Taurus and I became very spoiled  I miss it tremendously and may someday pay to have it put in  The other downside is the low gas mileage  We average about 19 miles to the gallon   which is a huge switch from the Taurus we drove previously  I would recommend this van to families that travel a lot or that have a lot to haul around  It is very comfortable and affordable br br  
  I n building the 1999 Corvette Hardtop  it was Chevrolet s intention to create a lightweight  budget Corvette designed for the hardcore driving enthusiast  Standard features in the  99 hardtop model include  a smooth 6 speed manual transmission  rigid Z51 suspension and a leaner weight reducing option list  all this when new was less than  40 000 i Driving Impressions i   W hen you step inside the  ultra sporty  1999 Corvette Hardtop  the  interior  may be a little stark  but remember  less garb means more go  When you fire up the engine  you know you are in a car that means business and  performance b  If the hardtop s engine sounds like the one in the coupe  it s because it relies on the same blistering 345 horse powered LS1 OHV V8  I hope you like manual transmissions  because the Hardtop can only be had with the 6 speed manual  The 1999 Vette Hardtop is a snap to drive  and  super fun  to boot  Burning rubber at stop lights in this machine is inevitable  and when this car gets on the open road it begs you to drive it fast  The smooth shifting 6 peed plays a big roll in the  fun factor  category   Handling  is excellent  and so is grip  The 1999 Corvette Hardtop boasts up to  90Gs of lateral acceleration  according to specs  Unlike the  suspension  system found on other C5 s  it is all about business with the hardtop s Z51 system  It  along with the Hardtop s rigid body  give a firm and reassuring ride without being too punishing   Braking  is also excellent  Chevrolet claims that the 99 vette can slow from 60mph to 0 in just 128 ft i About the engine i  Relying on the same  engine  that powers the coupe and the convertible models  the Hardtop has a 345 horse powered Ls1 engine under its sleek fiberglass hood  Though derived from Chevrolet s original small block V8  the now going on 6 year old  all aluminum Ls1 has no inter changeable parts like its predecessor  Instead  it relies on 6 bolt main bearing caps  a sequential port fuel injection system  and a composite intake manifold  Thanks to redesigned cylinder heads and an updated camshaft profile  the engine offers lots of torque all the way up to 6 000 RPM  The Hardtop s structure is the same as the other C5 s in the Corvette family  It relies on a separate steel frame supporting the fiberglass body  The Corvette s  suspension  has been very advanced for some time now  Alloy arms in front  and double wishbones  and a multi link rear  sprung by the corvettes familiar composite transverse leaf springs Improved rack and pinion steering  and the already mentioned 6 speed manual transmission complete the picture i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of my test  99 Corvette Hardtop was dressed in all black  You will notice that the Amenities associated with all the other Vettes are not as common place  These Luxury items have been somewhat sacrificed in the favor of performance  but the cabin still remains attractive  To save weight the C5 Hardtop does without several amenities that are in other C5 models  The dual zone air conditioning and memory package for the power seats  mirrors and radio are not available  Power windows and and locks are still standard  Daytime running lamps are also standard  The seats are very supportive and comfortable  and there is plenty of room for 2  needless to say  like all Corvettes  this is a two seater i Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  is as aggressive and sleek as the rest of the C5 Corvettes  and as I mentioned in my 1998 review on the C5 Corvette  this design kinda reminds me of the 95 Rx7  The paint was smooth  a creamy blue color  Wheels are 17  in the front and 18  in the rear  made of alloy   price   reliability b  For a used Corvette Hardtop expect to pay around  35 000  the C5 corvettes have been holding their value very well  Corvettes also have a very good reliability rating  according to rumor  www ConsumerReports com has more info  Many owners swear by the LS1 engine   Note b  The Hardtop is bound to become a collectors item  even if it is less expensive than the regular production Corvettes  This is because it was built in fewer numbers  and will have exclusivity as well as superior performance  and distinct looks on its side in the future Looking for a cheaper sports car  You may want to check out   a href content 57764449924  my review on the Camaro a     Happy Car Shopping 
 We bought an expedition recently and it is truly a great car  I also have a Chevrolet Tahoe that is pretty good too but not enough seats for my family of five  The expedition has the extra seat and in the 2000 series the third seat tilts forward for storage  great feature  It also has the new feature where the brake pedal moves to adjust to the driver  great for women  It also has heated seats which is great for cold regions  Other great features are heating and air controls for front and back  It has dual radio controls for front and back  this is ok for adults but may be a problem with kids at the controls in the second row seats  It is a tall car so you have to get use to getting and out  not a problem with us  We are truly glad that we bought the car  Another great feature is that the second seat can come down with the third still in place  Kids can have more comfort on long trips  tv in middle with all other junk between you and the kids for a little more peace  We bought a demo car and saved a lot of money  we had a choice of cars with around 2000 miles and saved about  5000     
 70 000 miles in 2 years in my Audi A4 TDi 110 have proved to be as enjoyable as they have been economical  The car was bought as much for its low running and contract hire costs as the Audi image that comes with it It is comfortable  quick and feels every bit as solid as when it was brand new  The fuel economy is exceptional even at high speed  Over 50 mpg is easily attainable and 90mph cruising drops consumption to the high 40 s  Minor electrical problems with the heated mirrors were fixed under the 60 000 mile warranty as was a broken catalytic converter   the car tends to sink low if it goes over a kerb and the underneath has grounded out a couple of times going over kerbs  Servicing is on the expensive side once the mileage gets beyond 50 000 but the dealer is friendly and always professional The A4 provides a better quality alternative to volume manufacturer alternatives at the same or slightly lower cost per mile   
 The new ML350 Inspiration Edition is a wonderful vehicle  and exactly what I need  so I bought one  I read the reviews of the M Class posted on many Web sites  and I can tell you that the 2003 ML350 Inspiration Edition has none of the foibles of the earlier M Class  even the 2003 ML320  replaced by the ML350  I traded an E320 sedan which I drove since buying it new in 1998  The ML350 Inspiration Edition is comparable in comfort  luxury and quality of interior trim  has more power  has a firmer but well controlled ride  and hauls everything a family of five needs to go to the lake on weekends  or can carry four adults in luxury and comfort with all of their luggage and golf gear on a weekend getaway   things my E Class just couldn t do I test drove a new 2003 ML320 before buying this vehicle  The ML320 wallowed on the road  leaned heavily in the corners  and you had to mash the accelerator to the floor to get it to  move  Then my dealer showed me the new ML350 Inspiration Edition  of which I understand only 900 will be produced  It has the new  and now standard  3 7 liter V6 with 232 hp and 254 lb ft of torque  comes with the ML500 wheels and tires  8 5  x 17  wheels with 275 55R17 109V tires  and the ML55 AMG upgraded leather interior  This ML350 pulls strongly  runs flat in corners with very little body roll and no plowing  and the rear end slips around in complete control  It is remarkably improved from the 2003 ML320 I test drove  and very different from the handling reported in many reviews of the ML320 of all years The exterior of the Inspiration Edition is distinguished from the standard ML350 by the same silver and chrome front grill found on the ML55 AMG  and by the ML500 wheels and tires mentioned above  The interior of the Inspiration Edition is taken from the ML55 AMG  deep grain anthracite leather  sport seats and black burl walnut trim  and is roomy  luxurious and quiet  The black walnut trim looks great with the charcoal leather  The white needled and chrome ringed instruments look much better than the standard  for the last 30 years or more  orange needled tach  speedo  fuel and temperature gauges  and give the 1998 vintage dash an updated look  The material now used on the dash looks and feels like leather  a great improvement over the original cheap  hard plastic dash  The 8 way power front sport seats  with their additional thigh and back bolsters  hold the driver and front passenger securely  The seat cushions are a trifle short for me at 6  3  tall   not an uncommon problem for me in vehicles but one I did not have in the E320  Otherwise the seating front and back is very comfortable  with tons of headroom all around  You could make toast on the high setting of the heated front seats  which quickly heat not only the seat cushion but also the lower section of the seat back  right in the small of your back where you want it  I can envision using the heated seat in the summer to loosen up a tight back on the way to the golf course  The second row seats fold flat without losing the load length right behind the front seats commonly lost in other vehicles  which typically have the rear seat cushion hinge forward and the seat back fold down  The folding mechanism is extremely easy to master  and the legroom in back can easily be adjusted  The doors and tailgate close with that characteristic Mercedes Benz  thunk  The optional Bose sound system is magnificent  and has a mode that centers the sound at the driver s head  so when driving alone you feel as if you are sitting in the acoustic center of the recording  One criticism of the sound system deserves mention  the on off volume knob for the radio CD tape in car phone system is positioned as far from the driver as the designer could put it  In fact  it is the most distant knob or switch from the driver on the dashboard  and people with shorter arms have and will continue to complain about its location  Surely the nearby  Low Range  transmission selector  which will be used infrequently  and then only when the vehicle is at a complete stop  could be swapped ergonomically with this knob that will be used many times each day  And there are no sound system controls  or controls of any kind  on the steering wheel  As a long time Mercedes Benz owner  I am used to some of the quirks like the cruise control stalk above the turn signal lever  and the window buttons on the console instead of on the door  After about a week  it feels completely natural to have them where they are  and extremely awkward and inconvenient to have to  push a cruise control button on the dash to turn on the cruise control and push a button on the steering wheel to set the cruise speed and push another button on the steering wheel to accelerate and push another button on the steering wheel to coast  as in many other vehicles  With Mercedes Benz  it s up to set or accelerate  down to set or decelerate  toward you to resume  and away from you to deactivate  Easy  One lever  No need to look and see if you have pushed the correct button of two  or three  And you won t accidentally use it to signal a turn after the third time you try that  The cup holders  objects of disdain to many owners  I think are perfect  but I am left handed  One at each end of the dash rotates out to hold perfectly and securely a 12 oz  can of beverage  and keep it up where you can grab it without looking down into the console  The huge cup holder in the center console will easily hold the largest liquid container you would feel comfortable bringing into the vehicle  The back seat passengers have two cup holders that slide out of the rear of the center console Every day I drive the ML350 Inspiration Edition  I love it more  No squeaks  no rattles  no vibrations  Rock solid  I would have hated driving the under powered and softly sprung ML320 that I test drove  The difference in handling is so dramatic that it must be the result of suspension modifications in addition to the wider wheels and tires  but I cannot find any source  including www mbusa com  that describes any additional upgrades to the ML350  On that subject  it seems as if the ML350 caught the automotive press totally by surprise  There are no reviews of it as of this writing  and all of the 2003 literature on the automotive Web sites and in the printed 2003 automobile buyer s guides talks about the ML320  with perhaps a mention of the 3 7 liter engine upgrade to come  The new engine is superb  Lots of power and torque  with nearly the same gas mileage as the 3 2 liter  and for much less money that the 5 0 liter ML500  The transmission is a driver adaptive electronic 5 speed that matches the shift pattern to your driving style  It also offers the option to shift manually by flicking the stick left to downshift and right to upshift Tree huggers rejoice  The ML350 is rated an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle  Worried about safety  The ML350 has air bags in all four doors as well as in the dash  and side curtain air bags for roll over and side impact head protection  Its front bumper is positioned at the standard height for automobiles so it won t ride up and over in a collision  Visibility in all directions is outstanding and better than in the E320 sedan  The ML 350 also features as standard equipment 4 wheel traction control  an electronic stability program  a downhill traction system  a  two foot mode  for crawling over obstacles  ABS  brake assist to give full braking power in an emergency  and a permanent 4 wheel drive system with a 2 speed transfer case for off roading  There is also an electronic brake force distributor to promote even brake pad wear by shifting more of the brake force to the rear wheels in straight line braking As for the competition  the BMW X5 is a four wheel drive sport station wagon  The ML350 is a four wheel drive sport light truck  They attract different owners with different hauling and off road driving needs  Compared to the X5 3 0i  the ML350 is less expensive  is much roomier and more comfortable  especially for back seat passengers  has more power  hauls more stuff  tows more effortlessly  and with its low range transmission and higher ground clearance can go off road under conditions that would limit the X5 s ability to keep up  They are both very safe vehicles  The X5 s handling is excellent  the ML350 s handling is very good  Other than that  the X5 does not do any of the things for which one buys an SUV  or an SAV in BimmerSpeak  namely haul people and things safely in inclement weather and or off road  as well as the ML350  The Acura MDX is a front driver that transfers traction to the back when the front wheels slip  with a fake wood interior  fewer luxury  traction and safety features  and the same price  The ML350 has a 48 52 front rear torque split   balanced all the time unless extra traction is needed at one or more wheels  Lexus is Lexus is High End Japanese  cushy  quiet  reliable  a dull drive  and always a year or two behind the Germans in engineering  I haven t driven the new Volkswagen and Porsche sport utes  and don t need to now The best is saved for last  Mercedes Benz has kept the price of the ML350 in line with its competitors  When you factor in the tax benefit of owning a vehicle with a GVWR in excess of 6 000 pounds  the ML and X5 meet this requirement   the Honda Pilot and Acura MDX  for example  do not  a good argument can be made that the ML350 is the best affordable SUV on the market The much maligned ML320 is dead Long live the ML350  
 This is the second Seville I have owned and the last  The first car was repurchased by Cadillac based on the  quot Lemon Law quot  The 1998 STS I now own has more quality problems that I can discuss  Cadillac s comments on some of my problems are  quot that s a characteristic quot  of the car  Drive line  quot thumps quot  seats that move by themselves  headlights that turn themselves off while going around a curve at night  need to turn off the radio before you can listen to a station  compressors that run all the time in the trunk area  wind noise  squeaks  rattles  finish that comes off the various buttons  poor leather  get the idea The dealers I have worked with have all been great  its the engineers in Detroit that need a consumer education br br  
 I bought this car out of an impulse  because of its good looks  because I like big  comfy cars  and because it s exotic  at least in here in Germany  but still a trustworthy brand I ve owned the car for 30 months now  doing about 50  city  20  highway and 30  vacation  Never been offroad with the vehicle Pros a  Engine Very powerful  silent and reliable engine  neither me nor my predecessor has ever had to take it to the shop or experienced any problems with it  Routine maintenance tasks are easy for a do it yourselfer  Everything is accessible and robust  no non standard tools required  This engine has run about 160 000 km  120 000 miles   so far  The automatic transmission hasn t caused troubles  too b  Body The body is solid and shows to signs of corrosion  even though it hasn t seen a garage for the past six years  The same goes for the doors  the hood and the tailgate  The tailgate latch is the only exception  all the paint came off and it s rusty all over c  Brakes The brakes brake unobstrusively and quick  the handling while brakeing is not as good as with ordinary cars  but better than I expected  The disks show only little signs of wear d  Interior Due to the vehicles height  the overview and the headroom are good  The instrumens are not beautiful  but functional  The leather on the seats still looks good  as do the plastic parts  Some find the seats too soft and surely the back seat passengers must either have short legs or be very enduring Cons a  Electrical Gadgets Almost all electrical gadgets were prone to error  The electrical rear view mirrors  the infrared door opener  the electrical window openers  the cruise control  the wiper motors  And the reason has always been the same  Contact problems   hard to track down but inexpensive  Chrysler could have used some superior parts here  as they obviously did under the hood and with the lighting  I ve never had these contact problems with core electrics or electronics b  Some Secondary Mechanical Things A similar pattern applies to accessability and quality of secondary things like the instrument control panel and the wiring and built of the intestines of the doors  locks and window mechanism  Whereas under the hood you see only solid and well thought engineering  these secondary things are obfuscated to the point of inaccessability and of minor quality  Some more screws instead of  snap fit  thingies would have made life a lot easier c  Keys The car keys are of unworthy quality and bend or break too easily  because the are too small Mixed blessings a  Handling The car handles surprisingly well in the city and overland  winter and summer  No weird reactions whatsoever  Highway driving  however  is not too pleasant because you really have to concentrate to keep a straight line at high speed  The power steering is simply too powerful and indirect  The tires and the drive train get quite loud too  unless serviced frequently   Oil change and greasing  Btw  This car really does still have some of these grease nipples I thought were extinct since the fifties  I personally like this  feature  folks that do not exactly enjoy lying on their backs underneath their cars probably won t b  Weirdly  some parts of the exhaust system do hardly ever corrode  and others rust like a soup can  Probably the quality of replacement parts is not uniform c  Heating  amp  Air Condition Given the size of the engine  the heating is sub standard  It takes an eternity to warm up  and on cold days I ve never felt more than lukewarm  literally  The air condition is somewhat better  but I doubt that it can counter real heat I hope I made a useful contribution br br  
  BACKGROUND  In this day and age when suburban utility vehicles  SUVs  are under assault from all directions as being politically incorrect gas hogs  not to mention being a general menace to the nation s highways it takes a moment of resolve to come forward and admit to having recently purchased an SUV  Himself and Yours Truly have done just that  After a fairly exhaustive exercise in researching a variety of multipurpose vehicles  we settled on the Saturn VUE  That conceded  the remainder of this review is offered to justify our purchase and to reclaim our credentials as politically conscious and caring individuals  First  let it be known that before September 2002  neither of us had ever heard of a Saturn VUE   That s not surprising  given that the first VUEs rolled down the assembly line during the 2002 product year  Our younger daughter bought a VUE and raved about its ease of handling  space age options  visual appeal  and versatility  All that  plus the end of the year markdown  made it an attractive deal for her  Himself s sister  the only family member living in close proximity to our daughter  was so impressed with the VUE that within a matter of weeks  she too purchased the same model for the then brand new 2003 model year  When we visited in October 2002  Himself drove both new vehicles and put the VUE on our list of possibilities for  next time  we might make a purchase Next time  came sooner than planned  While driving his 15 year old Subaru to work one morning in November 2002  Himself had a moment of clarity brought on by a general systems failure in his old road warrior  After drifting the mortally ill vehicle into a local service station  he parked  called me for assistance  and began the search that culminated in the purchase of our extended family s third VUE   Next time  was now So  why the VUE  For starters  it s a relatively handsome vehicle that is competitively priced  Indeed  we found the VUE with the options we chose to be well under the cost of other SUVs in its class  We purchased a front wheel drive with standard transmission plus the Sport Package of options  including a sunroof  upgraded upholstery and CD player  and other minor perks  which was thrown in at no extra cost  The Sport Package gave us most of the fun goodies we really wanted  and the  throw in  meant that the cost of said goodies would be at a price we were willing to accept b JUDGING FROM EXPERIENCE  After 14 months of ownership and 40 000 miles  our experience with the VUE can be summed up with the following observations   Gas Mileage b  Surprisingly  the VUE gets close to 30 mpg  making the decision to purchase the SUV not quite so anti environmentalist as it might have been with a larger  more powerful vehicle  Himself averages 28 29 mpg  mostly over urban interstate and rural county roadways  We attribute this result in large measure to the standard transmission and the 4 cylinder engine b General Performance b  Our VUE has been absolutely reliable  It has required nothing beyond standard maintenance that is  routine oil changes  gasoline  window screen fluid  antifreeze  and the standard warranty checks at the dealership included under our purchase agreement  One small but annoying problem has been that the windshield wiper nozzles tend to pop out  The dealer replaced the nozzles without taking undue issue and without cost b Interior Comfort b  For its body type  the VUE is comfortable  but not luxurious  The driver s bucket style seat allows up and down as well as back and forth positioning to seek out just the right driving stance  The front passenger seat reclines nicely to expedite Yours Truly s practice of enroute napping  Legroom in the front is more than we re accustomed to in small vehicles  In the best of all possible worlds  the front bucket seats could provide more lateral support  As it is  the lack of support is only noticeable during long trips or over rough terrain  Given that we live in West Virginia  Himself would appreciate a bit more of that support when traveling over mountain roads  Legroom for the backseat is perfectly adequate for Yours Truly at 5 5  but it s a tad snug for Himself at 6 0  The backseat itself is sufficient to accommodate two full sized child safety seats  With a bit of persuasion  we can even add a basic booster between the two safety seats  As involved grandparents  the ability to transport up to three children in safety gear of one sort or another is an important consideration   Appearance  b    Exterior i b  Like other Saturn models  the VUE has polymer panels that resist dents and rust is not an issue  Despite our VUE s bright red color  which might be expected to show damage more readily  our 14 month old vehicle sill looks  like new  It has withstood all the rigors associated with extreme weather  heavy road use  and the lack of its own protective garage b i Interior i b  The treated and upgraded upholstery has held up well  in spite of its light gray coloring  Heavy manufacturer s mats for front floor areas and the rear cargo space have helped in this regard  though less expensive mats would have served just as well b Storage b  The VUE s chief selling point in terms of storage is the rear cargo space  This area is more than adequate for routine shopping  and includes pop up bins to contain items that should absolutely not move around or be bumped by other items during transit  The cargo area is suitable for transporting all our vacation gear  up to and including Himself s not so small golf bag  Indeed  the VUE s cargo space was the  upturned ankle  that first attracted us  On our first encounter with this small SUV  Himself s sister met us at the airport with her VUE and with two other adult passengers  That meant that the trip back to her home would have to accommodate five adults  three   large   wheeled suitcases  Himself s golf bag  and various and sundry hand luggage  The VUE met the challenge with room to spare though admittedly  not much room to spare In the event that more storage is needed  and assuming there aren t five adults to transport  the backseat  in whole or in part  will fold down to allow for additional   flat   storage  Unlike other vehicles we have experienced with this option  the VUE s backseat modules fold down to a close approximation of flat much more so than most such arrangements The center console is designed as a suitable control space for up to four beverages two in front and two in back  The lidded bin in the console is appropriate as a catchall for all manner of small items  though it s not particularly spacious as a CD holder  which was its original design function   We use a visor CD case for that purpose  Fabric pockets  consisting of durable netting on the driver s and front passenger doors  make an ideal spot for housing maps  paperback books  and even small balls of yarn  the latter for my enroute crocheting between bouts of enroute napping  There is also a larger than average glove compartment on the passenger side of the front console Though we ve yet to use it  we had a manufacturer 146s roof rack added to our VUE  The installation was quick and fairly easy though we recommend that you allow the dealer do the install  just in case there are problems  The rack is not intrusive to the overall look of the vehicle  and it s nice to have again  just in case b Other Interior Features b  I m not crazy about some of the VUE s inside features and controls  For example  I find the location and operation of the window buttons awkward and inconsistent with any other vehicle I ve known well and traveled in often  I m always opening when I mean to close  and vice versa  I also think the center console could have been designed to utilize the space it occupies much more efficiently  Himself  on the other hand  seems quite content with both features  But then he always seems to acclimate rapidly to whatever quirks a vehicle might have in terms of control and adjustment b Safety Features b  Our VUE has front airbags for both the driver and the frontseat passenger  We opted against side airbags for the backseat at our elder daughter s request  As the mother of our grandchildren  she noted that airbags are unsafe for small children  Safety belts and harnesses are standard  of course  and snaplock latches keep the collapsible backseat modules in place b Ease of Handling b  The 5 speed standard transmission makes the VUE fun to drive for those who like the sense of feeling  in control  offered by an manual  The relatively small size of the vehicle can even support the illusion  some might say delusion  that one is driving a nifty sports car rather than a small SUV We re not zooming out of starting blocks at the race track  but 0 60 acceleration seems perfectly adequate to our needs well able to permit a jump start on most neighboring vehicles at the intersections we frequent  The power brakes are just that  and their responsiveness is well above average  In terms of driving in general  the VUE is smooth and easy turns included  with no noticeable tendency to list toward the outside   FINAL THOUGHTS  Would we buy the VUE again  Absolutely  we would  While I wouldn t likely be tempted to make us a two VUE family when the next purchase decision comes along  I m well pleased with the one we have  More to the point  Himself is pleased  He has a long  expensive commute  and the VUE gets him back and forth in relative safety and comfort  As for more luxurious cars sure  there are plenty out there  but we would pay dearly to beat the comfort we have  In terms of price yes  there are cheaper new vehicles than the VUE  but we would pay a significant price in terms of comfort  aesthetic driving pleasure  and probably safety  When considering value for money spent  we think the VUE deserves to be in a relatively small group at the top of the heap of automotive offerings  DAnneC BawBaw  2004 
 The early  90s were good for Ford  Sales were strong  recalls were few  Firestone tires were the norm and there was nothing wrong with that  By 1992 the Taurus had overtaken the Honda Accord as the best selling car in America  In fact it held on to the position until 1997 when the Toyota Camry won the sales race  So what was it about the Taurus that made it sell so well  Was it the looks  the performance  the quality  the price  I had only one encounter of an older Taurus before last week  a beat up 1989 model that a friend of mine used to own  Last week I got to drive a 1993 Taurus GL with only 71 000 miles  How would it compare to the last older Taurus I drove Powertrain  C  This Taurus like so may others had the venerable 3 0 liter pushrod  Vulcan  V6  It was good for about 140 horsepower  Keep in mind that the Taurus was amongst the bigger midsizers of its time so it was not surprising that this 3 0 liter was not quite up to the job  This engine makes quite a lot of noise for not much grunt and it knocked pretty bad  The performance is not helped by a transmission that shifts too soon for my tastes  The shift quality is poor  either it clunks or it slips just a bit  Taurus transmissions are legendary for failure and malfunction  Being that this example only had 72 000 miles made all the less encouraging   Update  As of August 2002 this Taurus blew its tranny with only 76 000 miles  It was soon junked  Sorry it took my almost a year to inform you all of this Handling Steering braking  D So many family sedans of this era had started to become more engaging to drive  The Nissan Maxima and Honda Accord were the sportiest  the Toyota Camry was the smoothest  the Mazda 626 and Nissan Altima being somewhere in between  But Ford tuned the Taurus to appeal to those who consider a car to be just an appliance  The Taurus has perfectly safe handling but the driving experience is numb and devoid of any sense of fun  The steering lacks any sort of feel  It heft is completely artificial  The response is imprecise  The suspension is tuned for a smooth ride but its softness contributes to more body roll than is comfortable  The brakes are horrid  The pedal feels spongy and I had to apply way more pressure than normally do  Overall  this car does not inspire any confidence Interior  D The Taurus was one of the bigger cars in its class  I really expected to be impressed by the interior room  But when I got behind the wheel of the Taurus  I discovered that I have it made in my  93 Mazda 626  My Mazda was one of the smallest cars in the class back then however it has a lot more front legroom than the Taurus  In this car  the wheel arches intrude exactly where I like to keep my left foot whereas my Mazda has plenty of foot room  The Ford s seats provide very little support and are not comfortable even on short trips  This GL model has a power driver s seat but surprisingly has no controls for the all important thigh support  The controls are fairly well laid out and the cupholder design is great IT HOLDS CUPS  Too bad it blocks the low mounted stereo  which has really small buttons  The overall quality of materials is quite bad  The plastic used on the dash and door panels just screams low buck  The fabrics used are not much better  The back seat is pretty roomy but like the fronts  they offer very little comfort and support  And for you skiers out there  the seat does not fold down  Thankfully the trunk is big albeit with a high liftover Exterior  B  As far as looks go the older Taurus was not bad  In late 1985 when the original Taurus made its debut it was cutting edge  The 1992 restyle made it look even better and more upscale  Even today it looks somewhat modern if pretty generic  It s a tried and true styling effort that certainly won t offend anybody  The same could not be said for the 1996 1999 fish face model  which offended many Overall  D It s sad to say that the older Taurus was simply not a very good car  I would like to have thought that given the low mileage it would have driven better  But in reality this babied 1993 model drove pretty much the way my friend s old beat up 1989 model  Just as an example  my 1993 Mazda 626 with 161 000 miles on has not led a charmed life  It was in a major accident once  Yet my  old bruiser  drives way better than the Taurus  It is better built  better engineered and a whole lot more comfortable  Plus its fun and has better resale value  The Honda Accord  Nissan Maxima and Toyota Camry are even better  So I d say skip the Taurus  You ll be glad you did  
 And we are amazed at how great it was  The ride was very smooth and gas mileage was even better than what the window sticker reported  Our two huge dogs  toddler in a car seat  and about 1000 lbs of cargo on both the roof rack and inside would scare most people into taking a plane  With the Venture  we still had room for our assortment of maps  books  etc  and even had one of those portable plug in fridges in the back  We have the optional air pump and hose and it has come in handy so many times  The controls are all in the right spots and easy to locate without having to take your eyes off the road  The cloth seats have proven themselves very durable as they have so far outlasted our toddler and our desire to use it for everything from groceries to hauling building and landscaping supplies  I have found that the seats are easy to remove and reinstall  kind of a no brainer there  If you don t want to remove them  the very back row folds up to create a lot of cargo space  Front seats have storage space beneath for everything you have a need to store and if that isnt enough  there are strategically placed cargo nets between the front row seats and one for in the back across the tail gate and other places for storage as well  There are tons of cup holders in this vehicle enough for everyone to have two drinks  Rear air and radio controls have been a plus as well  We almost bought a 2000 but the 1999 was a better buy for the options we got plus the controls are different in the  00 and not as appealing  If you are considering a  99  this is a nice van with affordable bells and whistles  This was a very well thought out vehicle plan  Another thing to think about is safety  Our van has front as well as side impact bags  Our sliding door has a feature that makes it slide back in case something gets caught in it  I would like it to have more sensitivity so it would not have to go so far before it would release  say  a toddler or an elderly person  If you leave your signal on after your turn for too long  a signal will beep an alarm at you  The locks automatically lock after putting your van into drive and will make warning signals if the sliding door is being operated  
 My last minivan was a Plymouth and it held up fairly well to the test of a 3 child family  but in September of 2001 we decided it was time to trade in the old minivan and seek something a little more dependable  My father has always been a GM fan and I guess I fell for that father knows best thing when he told me I should look at that Silhouette by Oldsmobile  My wife and I looked at Chevy  Chrysler  Dodge  Ford  Pontiac  and Oldsmobile  The Silhouette appeared to be a step above all of them  We loved the premiere edition which was the top of the line model of Silhouette  It was sleek  stylish  comfortable  and had all of the features that would make it perfect for our family  leather interior  easy to clean  built in entertainment center  no more  are we there yets  on those long trips  rear heat  keeps the kids cozy  and even seat warmers  to keep mom from complaining on those Ohio winter days  What I can say really sold us on this van though was the 5 year 60 000 mile warranty that was exclusive to the Olds since it is nearing the end of production  Everything appeared wonderful as we drove it off the lot and home to our garage We had the van for approximately 2 weeks when my daughter reported that they were getting no sound from the headsets when the entertainment center was on  We took the van to our dealer who assured us that this would be fixed  When we returned to pick up the van they assured us that they had tested all 4 headsets and it worked  When I got in it I noticed that 2 of the headsets were still in the plastic and my daughter stated that it still didn t work  The dealer kept the van for another day ripped a control unit from another brand new 2002 and put it into mine  This was of course covered under warranty  but not the end of my problems As you all probably know  the worst time to own a vehicle is right after a warranty expires around 36 000 miles  Well my van went in at 37 000 miles because the brake light was coming on  The list of things that the dealer found was staggering  Master cylinder needed replaced  2 wheel cylinders needed replaced  wheel bearing was loose  tie rod arm was loose  all 4 tires  and new brake pads  We of course were responsible for the tires and brakes even after my protest that the tie rod and wheel bearing surely caused the tires to wear prematurely the GM protection plan covered the rest  After this we had the van home exactly 1 week when my wife noticed water dripping from the overhead console  the thermometer was reading 107 degrees on a day where it was 25 degrees  the seat warmers wouldn t heat up  the air conditioner wasn t cold and the driver side power door would bounce back from time to time  We took the Olds back in and they replaced the main console due to a leak in a seal over the windshield  they also replaced the heaters in the seats  the AC condenser  and adjusted the doors  2 days later  the brake light is on again and it s back at the shop for the second time for the same problem I m frightened at what the future holds for this  30 000  purchase  GM used to make a quality vehicle  but at this point I m beginning to think that those days are gone Update  I just had to add this  A week after replacing the master cylinder again due to faulty parts  At least the dealer said this  the brake light is on again  It goes back to the shop for the 3rd time tomorrow for the same problem  
 I have always liked the ES300  having driven ridden in friends  ES300s since 92  Finally  I ve purchased one myself  the 2000 ES300  It s been a few weeks now and I feel that  by far  this is the most refined car I have ever had the pleasure of owning  Many of the great features have already been discussed by other Epinion members  so I will not repeat the detailed SPEC of the car here   Instead  I will use the space to talk about my own subjective opinion about the vehicle For years  I have been bugged by the criticism that the ES300 is nothing more than a disguised Toyota Camry  Honest to God it is not  However  I understand why people seem to think so  This is simply a natural phenomenon that a car manufacturer must face when they decide to open a luxury division  The same can be said about Acura Honda  Infiniti Nissan  or Audi VW  And it is more apparent for the luxury division s entry model vs the  regular  division s best models  Everybody knows by now that the ES300 shares the Camry s platform  The two cars also share certain components such as the power window switches  glass  you can tell by looking at the  TOYOTA  print on the glass  transmission shift  all minor stuff  The exterior is also similar  however  nowadays  most cars look very much like the Camry or Honda Accord  Some people tend to conclude too quickly that the ES300 is nothing but a Camry with the Lexus name  If you take the time to look at the details of the car  the differences are striking  Please  don t just glance at them for 2 seconds and decide that they are too similar  Notice the difference and tell me which exterior you prefer  The ES300 is like a big cousin of the Camry who is richer  more handsome and does everything better  I am not putting down the Camry here  I am only arguing against those who claim that the ES300 is not worth the extra cost Feel the atmosphere when you sit inside  surrounded by beautiful walnut wood and high quality leather seats  Look at the back lit instrument cluster light up as you turn on the engine  Be glad that you have the auto dimmed rear view mirror when a truck is close behind you at night  Enjoy the clear sound of the stereo and the effective climate control  believe me  It can get really cold or really warm  Both systems have such simple controls that do not require you to have an university degree to learn  and it takes an university degree to design something like this  The beeping alarm that goes on when I unlock lock the doors can be adjusted to a smaller volume which can be heard in public without being too obtrusive  The CD changer is in the glove box and yet the glove box is still larger than my previous Acura s  The exterior styling is aggressive and elegant at the same time  The 16  wheels  standard on the 2000 model  add to the already handsome look  Oh yes  did I mention the ride  The quietness and the smooth suspension in any kind of road condition make the ES300 feel like an even more expensive car  even better than my old first generation Toyota Avalon which they say is a Lexus in disguise K  Fit and finish is first class  ES300 is considered an entry level luxury sedan  That is true  However  it is also true that it certainly BELONGS in the luxury division unlike many other cars that pretend to be  with fake wood trim  harsher ride compensated by larger engine as being sporty  leather leatherette seats that crack easily  body structure that is fragile and squeaks K  none of these is found in the Lexus Thought and Attention to details  soothing atmosphere of the interior  comfortable and quiet ride K  the ES300 excels in these areas  Granted  the components that ES300 and the Camry share are high quality stuff  which says a lot about the Camry being a great car  The ES300 simply has so much more content that it s difficult for me to concentrate on the road while driving  I should just stop the car and stare at everything in admiration instead of doing it while I drive  I must admit also  that the acceleration and handling are not as good as the 2 door Acura 3 0 CL I traded in  Then again  the performance of the Lexus is already good enough for the purpose of being a safe and reliable primary family sedan for my wife and I  Take some time to look at each model in the market  Decide whether the value matches the extra cost  In my opinion  the Lexus ES300 is worth every extra penny  lots of them  that I spent in getting it instead of the Camry  I am truly enjoying this car K  I can t find any fault with it even if I tried  It s simply perfect for us br br  
 I was riding with my father in his Ford Taurus station wagon today to get some matierals for the construction workers that are remodeling our home  While in the car I thought it might be interesting to compare his car to my BMW 7 series  A review of my car can be read at  a href auto review 1E9A D8AFEF3 39277AA5 prod3 http www epinions com auto review 1E9A D8AFEF3 39277AA5 prod3 a  Some interesting facts I noticed was that the Taurus actually seems to accelerate smoother  and brake smoother than the BMW  although the BMW does accelerate faster  The seat comfort up front is comfortable in both cars  however I personally like the back seat more in the BMW  since it has head rests  and the seats are contoured for the body  For people with families that travel often and need room for luggage  such as my family  I would recommend the Taurus  For those who like to have luxuries  even to the point of having a weather station built into a car  I would recommend the BMW  The Taurus is also a smooth car  as is the BMW  The Ford is cheaper to get fixed  although it seems that it often does need fixing  usually nothing major  A recent fix was the air conditioning  which cost over  500 to fix  One feature that seems to be taken for granted in a lot of cars is the cup holder  The BMW does not even have one  although the Ford does  In the BMW I use the area on the door to place the cups  although it seems it was made for cassettes or CD s to be placed there  Another advantage of the Ford is that it is very good on gas  It gets probably about 8 mpg more than the BMW  when the BMW was purchased a gas guzzler tax needed to be paid  I like the Ford Taurus station wagon and would recommend it for families br br  
 Yeah a friend of mine had just purchased a brand new 99 nissan pathfinder fully loaded  This suv offers you a good amount of power  comfort throughout the entire vehicle  and it is very stylish which is a plus these days because nobody wants an ugly car like JEROME  The handeling on this car could be better it rolls a little bit in the turns but overall handles very good  The engine on this suv is not as powerful as its competition like the cherokee or the blazer or explorer but this suv rides more like a car and is easier to drive and offers you more comfort than the others  Anyone out there looking for a new or used suv i would have to say make sure you look at the nissan pathfinder i am sure you wont be dissapointed br br  
 I decided to lease my new 2000 Ford Explorer Sport for 24 months  My experience has been nothing but positive  The vehicle is extremely roomy for the driver and passenger and very comfortable for the quick trips to the supermarket and for the long drives across country  The only negative feedback is that I wish I had purchased my car instead of leasing it because I love it so much  Many times during this snowy winter in NY I have used the 4WD  It came in very handy going up the steep hills while all the cars were stuck in their paths  It worked like a charm the first and every time I wanted to use it  The truck has more than enough power  I have the larger V6 engine  and the acceleration seems to be better than any other car I have ever driven  The heater and air conditioner work extremely fast  I dont even drive a mile before the heat starts pouring out of the vents  The radio has many options  a CD and tape player combined  and the quality of sound is amazing  I think I am in Carnagie Hall  Other ammenities include a separate control for the radio in the back seat and a separate vent and control for the heat and air conditioning in the back as well  One of the most useful little options is the 2nd electrical outlet that comes in handy near the floor of the passenger s side of the dashboard  Another feature that I love is the digital thermometer and compass near the rear view mirror  Lastly  the convienence of having the headlights come on automatically when it gets dark outside may seem useless  but really comes in handy when you are as forgetful as I am  A negative about the car is that it eats gas like crazy  I only get about 200 250 miles per tank and it costs me about  25 to fill it up  Additionally  insurance seems to be a little steep for this car  especially if you are in a higher risk catagory I have received many compliments about my vehicle and would recommend anyone that wants to show a little style and practicality  to purchase an Explorer  Not only is it an economical purchase  but is a stylish semi luxery vehicle  I would defanitly take it out for a test drive br br  
 We own a  99 M3 and a 2000 323i  each with about 17 000 miles  We thought we had the ultimate driving machines until our neighbor showed up smiling in a 330xi  This model caught me by surprise and had I known about it  we would have waited on one of the BMWs we own  At the time  I couldn t imagine improving either car  but the 330xi improves on both in my opinion First  there s the 4 wheel drive  It s about as smooth and sophisticated as any I ve seen  It makes a great handling car handle even better  There just doesn t seem to be a way to take a corner without remarkable road hugging and a smile I couldn t contain after each turn  And oooooh  I d love to take this to the Sierras to ski  Our cars are nice to drive there  but the purely rear wheel drive has me out in the snow with frozen hands putting on chains  And even with chains  the handling isn t great  I almost bought an Audi A4 just for the 4 wheel drive  Had I known BMW would come out with it And the engine  I don t know how BMW made their smooth engine smoother  but they did  Like silk  They somehow chased the very last remnant of vibration away  It doesn t have quite the power of the M3  not many cars do  but it s a thrill and neither the 323 or 328 are I m not too fond of the chrome trim around the side windows  the 328 has it too while the 323 has black trim  but it looks okay in the steel blue color my neighbor has  I don t think it would look good in black or dark blue For the first time in my life  if my wife were to ask if it s lust she sees in my eyes as I watch my neighbor climb into her car  I d have to say yes br br  
 I grew up worshiping the quality of Japanese  German and Swedish cars  but I have to admit  my last few years driving this very inexpensive Ford have convinced me to consider another one the next time I need a new car  While it isn t much to look at  it has been immensely practical and reliable  I inherited this vehicle from my parents  and as a poor college student at the time I couldn t say no  despite its  quot grocery getter quot  nature  Now that I own a house  commute 20 miles to work in heavy traffic  and park in cramped lots  I appreciate its sizable cargo space  good gas mileage  and nimble handling  I recently recommended it to a friend and I recommend it to anyone out there who is looking for this type of vehicle  it is small and agile  with an excellent turning radius  it gets about 35mpg on mixed driving  can haul a lot more than you would think  and it s very reliable  Mine has 119k miles with only minimal maintenance  new belts and an alternator at 100k  and oil every 3 5k  It is a small car with a small engine  1 9L  so don t expect to outrun anyone  but it does have enough pickup for a normal driving  even in the aggressive Washington  DC traffic  The biggest problem  it s a station wagon and it looks like it  If you can swallow your pride  you ll save a lot of money with car br br  
 I am currently in the market for an SUV  Not being sure what I wanted  I spent my weekend wandering around the car dealerships trying to discern which prospective SUV will soon be parked in my driveway  The Nissan Xterra had caught my attention in commercials and advertisements  and even at the dealership  The price isn t too bad  it looks nice  plenty of room inside  Then I took one for a test drive  I ll start out with the good features  The car has lots of neat features  I like where they put the spare tire  underneath  it is well out of the way  yet easy to access  and it is a full spare  There is a lot of storage room in the back  and lots of hooks to secure items  The cargo area on the top of the vehicle is also convenient  And this really caught my attention  the smoothness of the ride  I have never ridden in a non luxury SUV that rides as smooth as the Xterra  It easily glides over bumps and potholes  The vehicle does unfortunately leave a lot to be desired  There are several obvious ways Nissan cut costs on this car  The most obvious being they did not have to re engineer the frame  They simply copied it from the Nissan Frontier  Extremely cheap plastic is used on the bumper  the type that easily will fade in the sun or any bad weather  I test drove the 4WD V6 automatic Xterra  It has decent acceleration  nothing to be overjoyed about  I would not be concerned except for the squealing the automatic transmission makes on a normal takeoff  It is very unsettling  The car also feels very top heavy on turns  even slight turns  The interior of the car is very  very plain  I was bored in the car  the monotony of the interior literally gave me a  blah  feeling  Controls are simplistic maybe in this case TOO simplistic  The rear seat that folds down to accomodate more room in the back is also very cheap  Two plastic clips are what holds the seat down  and they bottoms of the seat actually have to be removed before the back can be folded down  Also  the cargo bin on the top of the car only holds 30lbs  and it actually blocks the use of the sunroof  if the car is such equipped  The worst feature of all is that leasing is not cost effective  Most leases are  250  and that is the extremely underpowered  stripped  2WD version  The loaded 4WD usually runs in the mid to high  400 s  The braking on the Xterra is normal  and most features are so so  I was not overly impressed  thinking that the car would have lots of neat gadgets and features  but it does not  It is not a bad vehicle by any means  but might not be what some people expect  I think there are better options on the market  The Chevrolet Blazer and the Jeep Cherokee Sport offer very similar features at approximately the same price  without the cheap cost cuts br br  
 I got my Freelander at the beginning of May  2002  The ride is nice  yet  it struggles a bit going uphill  It would be great if Land Rover could add more horsepower  The independent suspension adds great comfort for the passengers  this technology is similar to the BMW X5  The  CommandShift  is standard for all  it was designed by BMW engineers There are some minor problems that I find with mine  Firstly  the air vent for the front leg seats are located at the center of the vehicle  therefore  the foot that is closer to the center is always hotter or colder than the other one  depending on which side you re sitting at  The interior craftsmanship raised some doubts Secondly  I upgraded the speakers to Harmon Kardon  it gives very rich sound  Yet  the subwoofer doesn t give as much as I expected  The release of the brakes gives a very odd sound  I went to the dealership to find out the cause  they explained to me that it is one of those things that I have to live with  I drove their Freelander courtesy car  I discovered it s not an uncommon issue with this model  Freelander has a three year dealer warranty  the dealer is happy to fix it up Otherwise  this soft off roader is very eye catching  The fuel consumption is not as bad as I thought  The best feature of this vehicle is the dent resistant bumpers  Although there is the lack of arm rests for the front passengers  I personally don t find it uncomfortable  At first  the leather seats might feel a bit high  but as the padding get worked in  they give good support  Regular maintenance is not that bad  it uses synthetic oil  therefore  only need an oil change every 20 000KM  When I do the math  it s the same as using non synthetic oil  considering non synthetic oil requires oil change every 5 000KM  
 I just got a 99 Infiniti G20 and let me tell you about the best car I have ever driven  This car is stylish  sporty  and affordable for a luxury car  The ride is pretty smooth for a smaller car and it can give you quite a kick of acceleration and a very good burst of speed if you need it  The sound system was surprisingly good  This Bose  6 speaker system tops out at around 100 150 watts  I have a sunroof  spoiler  6 CD changer  and a pretty nice leather interior  I think that red is one of the better colors on this car becuse it is not the loud  obnoxious red but it is more like a racing color red  This car is one of the most amazing all around cars that I have ever driven and I love being a proud owner of a 99 infiniti g20 br br  
 I have wanted this car since Honda came out with it  My husband talked me out of getting one til  quot all the bugs were worked out quot  but I think it was fully exterminated right off of the line  I finally got a 96  model in 98 and have loved every minute of driving it  I love the secure feel of this little car  nothing like the top off and a leisurely drive around the lake  Other than the ordinary maintenance  oil changes ect I have had NO problems out of this little car and the room in this little thing heck my 6 4 quot  brother in law fits just fine BIG recommendation for the Del Sol br br  
 I own a 96 two tone  North Woods limited edition Ford Ranger whats so limited bout it  I don t really know  its a 2 3liter 4 banger w  a stick  five overdrive  standard cab  long bed  Though I wish it was the otherway around  ext  cab  short box  Not enough leg room  and it doesn t have tilt  I heed you this  Dont get a Ford Ranger that doesn t have tilt steering  Thou can be dealt w  but gets frustratting on long trips  Overall seating is ahh well I guess comfortable for short rides but w  standard cab your bound to feel confined after an hour or longer trip  trust me I know  And I m not that tall either  at 5 10 quot  my knees start to bother me on long hauls  due to not so perfect seating arrangment  No  its not the clutch either  that I would add is very controled and perfectly calibrated  Not to hard or to mushy  just right feel  and very strong  even after one hell of a rigorois beating of tryin to sport the damn thing and revin up the r s to a point of redline and popping the clutch numerios times if I may add too  even after 41k miles  feels just the same as new  exactly the same  actually better due to break in  Brakes extremely well even though only has front anti lock  chassis settles very well and keeps comepletely controlled under exteme hard braking  manueverabititly well  Very well built  no problems at all Stong frame that can take much streess when pushed hard  can handle heavy loads very well  obvios engine lag and clutch stress but never seems to be a problem  Ya gotta consider  its only a 4 and its not built for speed or much power either  But is indeed an all around very trustworthly truck  Interior wise again  96 was the year that Ford transferd over to the more streamlined sexy looking interior all rounded off and flashier looking  Not enough elbow room left side     door side  seats pushed to close to door to make more room between seats  don t like that  Good visibility for instumentation  Very easy to use and explanatory fuctions make truck easy to drive  Like the rear cargo light  that isn t available on the S 10  so thats a plus for ford  but would like the option to have it on a separate swith  they come on w  the interior when turning on interior light which isn t to bad thou  Biggest disapointment  again the leg room on standard cab  The truck as a whole isn t all that aerodynamically designed or looking  but there isn t much road noise anyhow  Long bed accomates enough space  thou wish bed was just at least a bit deeper  Rear tailgate good weight  not to heavy  and not to light to bounce around on freeway when open either  Good overall road site   though having tilt would allow more over the hood  has great lighting for night driving  Thou one thing I dont like about fords new design of the wind shield wiper blade speed is that everytime you use the blinker  you can t help but to hit it and accidently change it  it being located right on the outside of the blinker lever  Thats where I give props to chevy  having the dial in the middle of the lever  0 60  with stick isn t all that bad w  no load  but can t sustain high speed cruise over 90 95 for the life of it  Winter months w  out any weight in the back totally suck here in MI w  all the snow we get  if you live in a snow climate  i d strongly advise 4WD  It looks better for the trucks anyways  the big tires  high stance  its speaks RANGER  4 banger s good on gas  but if you crave power  then its the 4 0 that you need w  out a doubt  Its a good starter truck  thats really all to it Anyquestions feel free to E mail at Tama1000 hotmail com br br  
 1997 Lexus ES300 The es300 is a mid size  near luxury  4 door car  This review will have 5 parts  Exterior  Interior  Performance  Reliability Service  and Price Exterior This is a beautiful car  I still do a double take every time I see one  and I could just look in my garage at mine  The lines of the car are smooth and refined  I particulary like the headlights  I feel they give this family car a sporty look Interior With almost all Lexus cars  leather interior is standard  Mine is not an exception  The leather seats are extremely comfortable and supportive  It makes a drive through rush hour traffic much more bearable than before  The ergonomics of the vehicle are outstanding  The instrument panel is easy to read  the stereo controls are a short reach away  The stereo itself is quite remarkable  I have the 6 disc CD changer option in the glove compartment  I would recommend this option if u are a music lover like myself  The car has plenty of room in both the back and front  3 passengers can fit comfortably in the rear  As with all Lexus vehicles  the interior is dead quite  regardless of city driving  or cruising on the interstate  Performance The es300 comes standard with a 3 0  24 valve  V6 engine  It provides smooth acceleration  while also providing good gas mileage  I usually get an average of around 25 with a mix of city highway driving  The engine is so quite and smooth  that I sometimes have to look at the Tach  to make sure the engine is running Reliability Service Lexus and their parent company of Toyota have always been industry leaders in terms of reliability  Many Lexus cars will run past 200k or even 300k in properly maintained  The service of Lexus dealers in outstanding  If you have to bring your car in for a repair or oil change  they will lend you and service car to use until the repairs are done  This is unheard of with any other auto manufactures in the United States  Price In 1997  I paid about 36k for my fully loaded Lexus  I consider that a bargain when comparing the service and pleasure of driving this vehicle day in and day out  Today my vehicle has 70k miles on it  and it blue books for  24 000  That is a testament to the value of these cars  Sure  you could spend a couple of thousand less for an American made car that is way behind in the quality of Lexus  But I strongly believe in the statement   You get what you paid for  Lexus is quality  
 I have wanted a mini van for some time  In February 1999  it became a reality  I had searched on line and did my homework  I got a good deal on a 1999 Ford Windstar LX I picked the Ford Windstar because of the 5 star safety rating  Safety is always my number one concern for my family  The car drives very good  and my only real complaint is that it feels like you have to press the gas hard to drive it  I rented another car company s mini van and it was so smooth to drive  The car does decent on gas for a larger car  It does have a larger tank than a car  so when the gas is expensive  it costs a bit  It handles ok in the snow  but does slide  I love the dual sliding doors  and would never get a mini van without one The seats do come out  but they are not easy to take out  I always have my husband take them out  as it is difficult for me and they are on the heavy side  It does make a lot of room when you need extra cargo  We also take out the back seat when going to the Drive In movies This is our second Ford  I will definitely buy a Ford Windstar again  unless another company builds a mini van that is just as safe and has a smoother drive Thank you for reading my review on the 1999 Ford Windstar br br  
 I have had my 1990 Bronco II for over 3 years now and still love it  I ve driven my truck to Alaska from Wisconsin twice and now I live in Fairbanks Alaska  It is tons of fun to drive in the deep snow at 40 below  Don t listen to the hype about Bronco II s being tippy  I take corners like do with any car  Most everything I have to say about the Bronco II is good  There are a few minor things that some other comparable SUVs have to offer There are many things to consider before buying a Bronco II  One of which is whether or not you have small childeren or if you will have elderly passengers  Access to the back seat can be difficult  It is almost impossible to get in the back from the driver s side  My mother  who is 50 years young  has trouble getting in the back seat from the passenger seat  It would be troublesome to put a child seat in the back as well There is one other flaw with the Bronco II  The rear door which swings up from the bottom makes it difficult to carry long cargo  Because the spare tire mount swings out  you cannot tie down the door  Here is a list of maintenance that I ve had to deal with my Bronco II  I ve had to replace my automatic hubs with manuals  becouse the automatic ones just could not take any abuse  The throwout barring in the transmission started making a racket so I had to have some barrings replaced  Other than tune ups and toys that is all I ve had to do to my favorite truck     
 We just got hit with 17 inches of snow in Maryland  The snow allowed me to test my Outback s All Wheel Drive  I am very impressed with how the wagon handled on my icy obstacle course to work  The wheels practically flew over piles of snow  the car felt stable on ice  and handled really well on slippery roads  Before I bought my Subaru  I owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee  I traveled to over 40 states in that Jeep and went off road in about 12 of them  After five years  I had to sell the car because I kept sinking money into it and constantly found more problems to deal with  When I sold my Jeep  I knew I wanted a car that had 4 Wheel Drive capabilities and style  I shopped around and test drove Toyota  Mazda  and Subaru  I did not like the feel of the Toyota and Mazda when I drove them  I felt like the cars would not respond to my foot on the pedal  and the cars felt clunky  I was happily surprised by the speed of the Subaru  My head jerked back ever so slightly when I put my foot to the pedal  I had the hardest time trying to decide between the Forester and the Outback  Both cars had similar features and capabilities  My three year old son decided for me when he put his hands on the bumper of the Outback in the showroom  He told me   quot This is going to be our Batman car quot  I purchased a black Subaru Outback with a leather interior and cd player  I am a young single mother  and I wanted a car that reflected my needs and personality  I felt like the style  speed  and AWD of the Outback fit my young and adventurous lifestyle  The reliability  safety and child features appealed to the responsible mother in me  The gas mileage is great  The city mileage is about 21 miles per gallon which is what my Jeep got on the highway on a good day  My son was right about our car  like the Batmobile  our Subaru wagon was dark  sleek  and very useful  Unlike the Jeep  I feel like my Subaru will last me a lot longer than five years  Everyone who has owned a Subaru raves about the customer service and longevity of the cars br br  
 We bought our first Dakota back in 1993 and now wouldn t own any other brand of truck  The club cab feature provides room for all three of our children and still enough leg room for my 6  husband to be comfortable This truck has been through the ringer and still comes back for more  Now after 6 years  195 000 miles  pulling 16  stock trailers full of horses and cattle it is still going strong  We originally bought the truck for a  quot home to work quot  vehicle but this little work horse has been a God send It has had tires replaced three times  oil changes every 3 000 miles and no major repairs needed  The paint has held up under the harsh reality of sitting at a chemical plant 5 days a week  There was only two drawbacks to the Dakota  The first is the cruise control and air conditioning went out the second year and these were not covered by the extended warrantee  No air conditioning in Texas in the summer can be rough  The cruise control was easily lived with out If you are looking for a dependable  long lasting truck that doesn t cost an arm and a leg  check out the Dakota     
 After having had many bad experiences with American manufactured cars  I decided to take a chance on the Chevy Impala 2000 upon some recommendations  I have had the car for one year and have driven it for a little over 10 000 miles  It is a good  solid  reliable car and the engine has not given me any problems  There is easy access to the trunk from the back seat  The back seat can be folded down to get to the trunk  Interior and exterior style is impressive  Now  for some minor cosmetic defects  The dashboard is so big and wide that you cannot reach the front of the windshield to put the county and state inspection sticker on  When you press down on the emergency brake  you hit the speaker on the left side  When you press the button inside the car to open the trunk  the trunk just unlocks  it doesn t open  always sticks  There is no convenient handle to open the trunk  really annoying aspect  The ride could be more comfortable   shocks need improvement Despite some minor cosmetic problems  I would recommend this car if you are looking for a solid  reliable car  
 Pros  Looks nice when it s clean  Reliable so far  Sits up high like most SUVs  It s not too big nor too small  Priced fairly Cons  Poor gas mileage  18 MPG around town   20 MPG highway  The biggest single negative feature is the child restraints or lack of adequate restraints in the rear seats  Child seats tip going around corners  I have advised Ford of this problem and they have not seen fit to warn potential buyers I purchased this vehicle because it looked nice and I ve never owned an SUV  I haven t seen many Ford Explorer Sports on the road so far  probably because of the Firestone tire recall that was all over the news some weeks ago  I m told that Firestone tires on this vehicle are not affected by the recall because they are 16 inch tires EXTERIOR  8 I purchased a black SUV and it looks beautiful when clean and shiny  Unfortunately most black vehicles need a considerable amount of care  The design is just right for my taste  it s not too large  like some SUVs  but it does take some getting use to judging distances when parking  The middle windows have a slight tint and the rear windows have a darker tint  The rear window is dark enough so I don t have to change my inside rear view mirror at night INTERIOR  6 I give the interior a 6 primarily because of the potentially dangerous child car seat restraints are none existent  My two and three year old grandchildren were tipping back and forth going slow around turns  The rear seating is for two people  only  Seatbelts exist only for two people and no more  If I d noticed this when I was considering the purchase  I would not have bought the vehicle The interior color is grey with a synthetic leather which appears to wear on the drivers side very fast for only six months of use  ENGINE  8 The V6 appears to have adequate power  As mentioned earlier  my only difficulty comes with the poor fuel economy  Sorry  but there s no good excuse for poor gas mileage this day and age RIDE  6 The Ford Explorer Sport is a truck of sorts and rides like one  Obvioulsy not as smooth as a passenger car but I would have no problem taking this vehicle off road before I d take other passenger car  You will feel most small pot holes and cracks in the road HANDLING  7 Highway driving concerns me the most  I m very careful not to make any sudden steering control turns because I feel this vehicle will turn over like many SUVs have to date  This is probably do to the higher than normal center of gravity  The 4 wheel drive worked well during a recent snow storm  The brakes are beginning to grab and make noises already RELIABILITY  9 So far this SUV has been reliable  probably because I paid a considerably fee for extra protection at the dealership  Like anything else  I ll get very concerned when the extended warranty expires  Car are very expensive to repair VALUE  6 Considering the price  it s a fair value  not great  just fair EXTRA FEATURES  7 I purchased a model with a 6 CD Pioneer Changer in the dash  The CD works great THE VERDICT  I would not consider another Ford Explorer SPORT for my next purchase  There has to be much better products out there for a better price AVERAGE SCORE  7 125 out of 10 Comfort  Ok except on bumpy roads Quality  Little noise  but not too bad Roominess  Adequate Handling  amp  Control  Good Condition  New Model Year  2001 Model and options  Satisfactory Recommend to friends or family  NO    
 This is an update on the report I wrote a while ago on my car  I currently have 108 000kms on the odometer and have had some more serious problems since the last review  I still maintain my opinions about the awesome driving dynamics of the car and the powerful and delightfully high revving V6 engine that powers it  Every time I drive the car  it never ceases to amaze me and amuse me  I absolutely love the engine  It sounds so great and is more than adequate to move the car along  I still waste much more gas than I should  but I can t resist the beautiful music the motor makes when it reaches top RPMs and the corresponding pull it develops  I recently had the brake pads and rotors replaced since the originals were warped and had hairline cracks developing due to age   but hey  106 000 kms out of the original brakes is really something   especially considering that this car has been DRIVEN  The car has 4 wheel discs  with ABS  so the brake job was rather expensive  but obviously necessary  Now for the bad aspects  The waterpump and its gasket blew in the summer  some ABS regulator blew at the same time  the low speed fan and some other components broke 2 days after I got the car back from the aforementioned repairs  That alone would have cost me around  4000CDN if it weren t for the extended warranty  The splash shield has been rattling around badly and actually fell off after the fan was replaced since it wasn t reattatched properly  I ve had some dash lights burn out and I have also had a tie rod break somehow   don t ask   I don t know The car is in good repair right now except for the resonator which is bad just due to age  but the rest of the exhaust system is looking all right  The glitches have finally been sorted out   it s about time  However the time has come to sell the car and get something new  A VW Golf GLS 1 8T is a definite prospect  No matter what kind of car I get next  even if it were a Ferrari  I will miss the Contour  It hasn t been the most reliable car  by any means  but it has definitely been a great driving car  it still puts an ear to ear grin on my face when I drive it  High performance out of a sleeper sedan  I love it  My ownership has definitely been characterized with a love hate type relationship with this car  I love it when it works  I hate it when it s in the shop  As for the bad resonator  I think I ll leave it be  because if I fix it something else is bound to go wrong  I can live with a slightly louder than normal exhaust system     
 For some reason  to me  Infinitis dont get near the respect they deserve  At the moment they are not held at the pinnacle that other luxury cars are  The infiniti provides a sleek design and a beautiful ride  I survived a six hour ride in a Q45 one time  Thats a lot for a car  The Q45 is silent  the motor purrs with each tap of the accelerator  When you talk about BMW  Mercedes  and Jaguar  without a doubt the Infiniti deserves to be there as well The price tag is lower than most in its class  yet it drives better than many BMW s I have ridden in  If you are in the hunt for a car of this calibur  and are sick of seeing millions of BMWs on the road  the Infiniti is for you  Original  sleek  and fun     
 Compact  car based SUVs are the hottest segment of the market right now  Toyota and Honda have offered such vehicles for about five years now  The first generation RAV4 and CR V weren 146t quite right for the American market 151Toyota and Honda didn 146t originally intend to offer them here 151but the second generation of each is much improved  Ford really blew the segment open last year with the Escape  which brought V6 power and a top SUV brand to the segment  Now GM is getting into the game with the VUE  offered by Saturn Saturn is a logical place for such a vehicle  The Japanese created this segment  and Saturn was created by GM to copy the Japanese  and especially Honda  as far as product was concerned  Think of the VUE as Saturn 146s knock off of the CR V  and you won 146t be far off  Still  there are a few significant differences between the two vehicles  I 146ll cover these as I make my way through this review Note  Before the VUE was listed  I wrote a   a href content 51002707588 comparison a b  of the Escape  CR V  and VUE that is listed under the 2002 Escape  click on the hyperlink to go there  That review focuses more equally on the three vehicles  such that it is even longer than this one i Update   A second  more thorough test drive of a 2003 VUE has led me to significantly downgrade my evaluation of the vehicle  For the details behind this decision  see my review of the 2003   a href content 78752157316 here a b b Styling and Accommodations  In styling  the VUE looks like a Saturn SUV might be expected to look  clean and friendly with a touch of quirky  Saturn stumbled when its designs got too plain in the late 90s  and it has learned from this experience  In the VUE  some character is provided by flared wheel openings  Audi esque cutlines where the bumper fascias meet the body  okay  Olds and Saturn did this first  but it looks better on the A6  an upward sweeping indentation in the doors  and a hood that wraps over a bit into the fenders  The last warrants a bit more comment  Like the S Series  small  Saturn  the VUE uses space frame construction  What this means is that the metal frame provides all of the structural strength of the vehicle  enabling the fenders and door skins to be made of plastic   The larger  L Series Saturns have plastic front fenders and door skins  but metal rear fenders that contribute to the structure  On the plus side  these panels resist dents and won 146t rust  not that vehicles rust much anymore  with today 146s anti corrosion technology  The downside of plastic panels is that they expand and contract quite a bit with temperature variations  so the gaps between them must be larger  Some reviews have criticized these gaps on the VUE  saying they allow fingers to be inserted up to the second knuckle  This has not been the case on the VUEs I have seen  The gaps are perhaps twice as broad as those on a Honda or Toyota  but they are much narrower than those I 146ve seen on past Saturns  and very even  Now for that hood  The VUE 146s designers appear to have incorporated wider than normal panel gaps into the design  The way the A pillar and hood are styled accentuate these gaps rather than hide them  lending the product a hyper functional  overtly structural character where each panel is clearly visible as a distinct part of the whole  I personally think it works  A few other features of the exterior design bear mention  The front end is perhaps the most car like of any SUV  with very horizontal headlamps  Owing to these lamps  the VUE from the font looks like a car that has been given a serious suspension lift  The much more expensive Audi Allroad looks much the same way  Some people expect their SUVs to look more trucky  but then they 146ll probably want other aspects of the vehicle to be more trucky as well  Think of this front end as truth in styling  The rear end is marked by blacked out D pillars  making it look as if the glass wraps around from one side all the way around the back to the other  The original CR V was similarly styled in this area  That the new one has painted D pillars  like just about every other SUV  suggests that Honda learned that SUV buyers desire the more rugged  stronger look of painted pillars  Though other features of the VUE 146s styling may be quirkier  this one may cause Saturn the most heartache Some people will not like this or that detail of the design  but Saturn learned the hard way that overly safe designs make its vehicles too similar to everything else  and thus invisible to many potential buyers  Overall  I think they did a good job  The VUE is unique  it looks like a Saturn  and above all it looks both fun and sophisticated  Though about the same size as the CR V  the VUE has more presence and generally looks much less like a toy SUV  I say cut Saturn some slack and be thankful it 146s not a blatant copy of the CR V or Escape  The VUE 146s interior styling is more conventional  The gauges and switches generally come from other Saturns  Overall  they look and function well  Some people will object to the power window controls 146 location near the shifter  but I don 146t mind it  The basic design of the dash resembles the Lexus RX 300  with the shifter mounted on a shelf that protrudes from the center of the dash  Lower down  on the floor between the seats  Saturn has included a low  non movable center console with a smallish storage compartment and cupholders  The last might be too low to be used easily  I suspect it 146s low to attempt to mimic the open feeling in the front seat of the CR V  Unfortunately  the promontory on which the shifter is mounted kills that effect  I don 146t mind the sportier ambiance this design lends myself  but there is something to be said from the much more spacious feeling of the CR V  with its column mounted shifter  dash mounted parking brake  and fold away console  A significant difference to keep in mind  either way My least favorite part of the interior design is the door panels  The rear half of these  like the center console  is made of hard plastic with a pebbled surface texture  It looks and feels cheap  The padded door panels and armrests of the Saturn L series are much missed here  Overall  the VUE 146s interior is more stylish than those in the CR V and Escape  but the quality of some materials takes away from this potential bonus  The higher quality materials in the CR V reinforce its utilitarian aesthetic  recalling older Mercedes  Though the materials in the Escape may be even a notch below those in the Saturn  they are somehow seem less out of place in the Escape 146s more utilitarian interior design  Redesigning the door panels and center console would help the VUE a great deal I have already mentioned that the CR V 146s interior feels more spacious  This is partly due to its design  but also because it is more spacious  Though the VUE is three inches longer and an inch wider than the Honda  it has 6  less passenger volume  Most notably  it has an inch less shoulder room  more significant than it would seem  and a whopping three inches less rear legroom  front legroom is virtually identical  This last disadvantage may be the largest weakness of the VUE  The new CR V has a very spacious  surprisingly comfortable rear seat  It 146s not just that the Honda has 39 4 inches of rear legroom  which is big car territory  It also helps a great deal that the Honda 146s rear seat cushion is mounted high off the floor  so it provides thigh support to adult males  The rear seat in the Escape is similarly high  such that it is also comfortable despite providing the same amount of legroom as the VUE on paper  The VUE 146s rear seat  in contrast  is mounted fairly low  as is frequently the case in GM vehicles  As a result  it provides insufficient thigh support 151adults closer to six feet than five will have a bit of that  knees in your throat  feeling  It does not help that the map pocket on the back of the driver 146s seat bulges out  making contact with the shins of this 5 148 male   There is a bit more room behind the passenger seat  which has a plastic back Why didn 146t Saturn mount the cushion higher  There is more than enough headroom  so that wasn 146t the limiting factor it often is in sedans  It seems that they wanted to avoid the complexity and expense involved in having the rear seat cushion fold forward when the rear seatback is folded to enlarge the cargo area  In the Honda and Ford  to get a flat load floor the rear seat cushion  because of its height off the floor  must fold forward when the rear seatback does  I don 146t know how much this costs  I do know its not an inconvenience in these vehicles because the cushions are linked to the seatbacks in such a way that only one step is necessary  Saturn should have done the same Front seat comfort is better  The seats are moderately firm  softer than those in the Honda but not too much so  Though lateral support is minimal  you sink in just enough to feel well supported in regular driving  The front seats are fairly high up  and combined with a large amount of glass afford excellent visibility  especially forward  Some of the pillars are a bit thick  but none obtrusively so  As in the CR V and uplevel Escape  a manual height adjustment is standard  Also as in the Honda but unlike the Ford  leather and a power seat are not available  Leather will be available next year  Saturn may be copying Honda a bit much here  Leather isn 146t just for luxury cars anymore  as a company that offers it in its smallest car should know  The dealer can have leather installed  but many people want their upholstery to come from the factory Many people buy SUVs for their interior versatility  Here the VUE comes up a bit short  but not overly so  As in the Honda  and PT Cruiser  for that matter  the front passenger seatback folds forward to permit very large objects to be carried inside  One unique feature is a cargo organizer that folds out of the floor to form a box about one by three feet in size  It is a bit flimsy  but not nearly to the degree some other reviews have suggested  It should be more than up to the task of keeping small objects or a few grocery bags from rolling about the interior With the rear seatback up or down  there is a usable amount of cargo space  But there could be more  Though a bit smaller outside  the Honda provides about ten percent more cargo volume inside  Credit blame goes largely to the location of the spare  The CR V 146s is mounted on the tailgate  while the VUE 146s  like the Escape 146s  is under the cargo floor  As a result  the cargo floor is lower in the CR V  and a decent amount of additional storage is available beneath it  That fixed rear seat cushion also causes problems here for the VUE 151the rear seat doesn 146t quite fold flat  though I suspect a bit of weight on it might fix this by compressing the seat cushion  Many people will be more than willing to give up 10  of their cargo room in exchange for the advantages of having the spare inside  Though this means the spare cannot be full size  it stays cleaner there  and is less likely to rattle  It allows the vehicle to look more sleek and car like  Perhaps most importantly  in a minor rear collision the spare won 146t be pushed into the tailgate  causing hundreds of dollars of damage  This is a danger on the CR V  and on the Toyota RAV4 as well  since the spare extends further rearward than the bumper  Sadly  Saturn has not gone all the way and constructed the rear bumper to car standards  Small SUVs tend to have weak rear bumpers  such that minor rear collisions result in much damage  and I note that only the front bumper of the VUE is rated to withstand a 5 MPH hit  The competition doesn 146t do any better  and often does worse  but Saturn could have led here One final area where the VUE comes up a bit short is the tailgate  Like the Escape but unlike the Honda  it opens upward rather than to the side  Some people prefer one  some the other  Shorter people can have trouble closing upward opening tailgates  and taller people can hit their heads on them  but they do get more out of the way  Neither is easy to open in a closed garage  That 146s where a separately opening liftglass can help  Unfortunately  the VUE  unlike most of its competitors  does not offer this feature  Because it often preferable to open only the glass  many buyers will be disappointed by this omission   On the Road  One area where the VUE promises to trump the CR V is on the road  Though the second generation CR V has a larger  more powerful engine  it 146s still a four cylinder  Some people  myself among them  would much rather have the more refined sounds and sensations of a six  Like the Escape but unlike the CR V  the VUE is available with both a four and a six  Both engines are slightly modified versions of those in Saturn 146s L series cars  They bracket the CR V 146s engines in power  While the Honda 146s four produces 160 horsepower  the VUE 146s four produces 143 and the its six produces 180  Performance is not a simple function of horsepower  Transmissions also affect performance  Saturn provides two unique transmissions in this class  Instead of a conventional automatic  the four will soon be available with a continuously variable transmission  CVT  I have described such a transmission in detail in my A4 review  To cut to the chase here  a CVT permits an engine to be held at the power peak as the vehicle accelerates  such that it produces full power all the time rather than losing a great deal of power every time the transmission shifts and RPM consequently drop  Though the Saturn four makes 10  less power than the Honda 146s  the CVT should compensate for this  Weight also affects performance  but since the two vehicles 146 weights are almost identical  their acceleration should be close  On the downside  holding the engine at a constant RPM feels a bit strange and could result in a great deal of noise unless the engine is very refined  which the Saturn 146s is not  Since a CVT is not yet available for a test drive  this is all theoretical for now The six 146s acceleration is aided by a five speed automatic  The extra gear compared to the competition permits a shorter first gear  for quicker acceleration  and a taller top gear  for more relaxed and more economical highway cruising  Since I drove the six  I can go beyond theory in this case  In short  that extra gear is not enough to compensate for a 10  power deficit compared to the similarly hefty Escape  The six 146s acceleration will be more than adequate for 90  of buyers  but for those that value acceleration above all else the Escape has a definite advantage  I don 146t know why the Saturn 146s six doesn 146t make more power  It 146s the same size as that in the Escape  and 180 horsepower is definitely on the low side for a 3 0 liter 24 valve V6  Saturn should be able to find at least 15 more horses here without resorting to premium fuel Too much should not be made of this disadvantage  For the great majority of buyers that care about more than 0 60  the VUE will offer an appealing balance  It 146s six is significantly torquier in feel than the Honda four  Though far from silent  and fairly loud when pushed  it is much more refined sounding than the gruff six in the Escape  The Saturn 146s six may not offer blistering acceleration  but it never sounds strained or rough  The engine is an Opel  GM of Europe  design  and its European origins are evident here  As far as economy goes  the numbers on the sticker were 19 25  short of the CR V 146s 22 26  but better than the Escape 146s 18 24  and far better than conventional SUVs  Overall  economy should be comparable to a six cylinder sedan The VUE 146s four wheel drive system is very similar to that in the Honda  Usually power goes entirely to the front wheels  but if these slip some power is automatically diverted to the rear wheels  This occurs very quickly  and is transparent to the driver  Such a system is generally intended for slippery roads  not going off road  I drove the VUE over roads with a bit of ice on them  and it performed well  The Escape has a bit of an advantage here  Left in  147auto 148 the Escape 146s system functions much like those in the Honda and Saturn  But a switch is provided to lock the system in all wheel drive  such that torque is split 50 50 between the front and rear  much like in the RAV4  This provides a little more off road capability  and subtly affects handling  That said  the Escape like the others lacks a low range  and is generally not designed for off road use Handling is a VUE strong suit  Much like the new CR V  it feels solid and composed on the road  Partly due to higher steering effort  the VUE does feel less nimble than the CR V  Unfortunately  the higher steering effort does not translate into more road feel  The VUE uses an innovative power steering system that gets its assist from an electric motor rather than an engine driven hydraulic pump  which should aid fuel economy  While this system was a match for the best GM has to offer  and is not noticeably different than conventional power steering  it was not up to Honda standards in road feel  That said  many people  especially men  will prefer the higher effort for the somewhat European  higher performance feel it imparts  One clear advantage of the VUE also plays a role here  it rolls less in turns than the CR V  and perhaps any other vehicle in this class  The taller Escape rolls quite a bit more  and generally feels less car like Compared to the Escape  both the VUE and CR V are significantly quieter and generally feel more refined  Like the CR V and more so than the Escape  the VUE rides like a good sedan  The low amount of lean for an SUV does not come at the cost of a poor ride b Pricing  Adjusted for options  the six costs  1 665 more than the four  about in line with what the Japanese charge for a six  This amount is fairly reasonable  but could be lower  In the Escape  the six costs  1 510 151and that includes an automatic transmission  easily  800 on its own  I suspect that this difference is because Ford doesn 146t intend to sell many Escapes with the four  while Saturn does  This cost difference filters through to the bottom line  The stickers are not too far apart  the Escape 146s with similar equipment  the main difference being a power seat in the Ford  is about  200 less  But Saturns sell at sticker  while a thousand dollar discount  or more  shouldn 146t be hard to find on the Ford  Compared to the CR V  the VUE may also have a hard time on price  Though in this case both should sell at sticker  the VUE with the four stickers for nearly a grand more than the CR V  adjusted for equipment  Get the six  and you 146re looking at  2 600 more than the Honda  a sizable chunk of change   Last Words  Though the prices could be a bit lower  the VUE has much to recommend it  It has unique  sophisticated styling  Its six is reasonably powerful and refined  Its steering is firm  and it rolls less than the competition in turns  yet it also rides comfortably  Visibility from the driver 146s seat is very good  and the cargo area is fairly versatile  Perhaps more than any of these individual strengths  the combination of them is appealing  They add up to a more adult yet still fun vehicle than the competition  Overall  for many buyers I suspect these strengths will outweigh the VUE 146s weaknesses  most notably the quality of some interior materials  insufficient room and thigh support in the rear seat  and the non opening tailgate window  A final factor that will affect many decisions is the Saturn dealer experience  Saturn dealers are well known for treating their customers well  even too well for those who find all the friendly overtures over the top  A more stress free buying and owning experience cannot be found anywhere

 I bought my 1999 Rodeo used in March of this year with 25 000 miles  I loved the shape which I considered more attractive than any other SUV  I researched for months before deciding on the Rodeo  But most important is the fact that less than a month ago I heard a sound as if it was in third gear or idling too fast  The next day as soon as I started it and put it into reverse  the throttle went wide open and it went straight back into a tree  which then knocked it into a gear and it went forward throttle wide open into my house  The brakes were being used the whole time but wouldn t stop the car  The car is totaled now and a mechanic found that something was making the throttle go wide open  Now my insurance company is investigating as to why this happened  I have read similar fast idle stories in Edmund s Town Hall and in my opinion I am afraid this may happen to someone else  I had only put 7 000 miles on it before this happened  I was lucky that it didn t happen while I was going down the road  Everyone please be leery about buying any used Rodeo     
 JAN 3 RD 04 UPDATE I ve since taken this vehicle on a gruelling 6 000 kilometer   two week road trip through eastern Canada and the U S  It performed flawlessly   Considering the Consumer Reports upgrade on reliability for this vehicle   I feel VERY comfortable in raising my rating to a five star   If my opinion changes   I ll update it  Thanks I previously owned a 1996 Ford Escort Wagon and I liked it and as I am involved in many outdoor activities   camping  canoeing  I wanted another wagon type vehicle which can move my gear without high maintenance and fuel costs   I researched the Focus Wagon   Volkswagon Jetta Wagon   Toyota Matrix   and the Subaru Forester   My primary research tool was the internet combined with Epinions and Consumer Reports  What swayed my decision was the ZTW has the best cargo space in its class and is incredible value for the money  CONS First off let me say I hate tires   The ZTW comes stock with Firestone Firehawks P205 50R16 H rated tires   They have adequate dry handling   average wet   and are terrible in the snow   As soon as I can replace these tires I will   plus next winter I will invest in a good set of snow tires   The one problem being the tire size   The stock size is not very common so replacements are few and very pricey  Secondly   I find it very annoying that there is no exterior back door latch   The rear hatch can only be opened by key   remote fob   or the release button inside the car  Plus   with the absence of a handle   you have to lift the door up by grasping somewhere around the edge which is often dirty  Last   I find the antena placement  up front in the middle of the roof   silly   It will bang when you go through a touchless car wash and it is non retractable   When I load a canoe on top it is in the way   I wish Ford would go back to the retractable side placement  PROS I purchased this vehicle in Grimsby   Ontario   Canada   for   21 200 base price    25 500 with all government taxes   I estimate this is at least  5 000 to   6 000 below the Forester and Jetta Wagon   both great cars  The interior is roomy and controls are VERY well laid out   The fit and finish is very nice   unusual for a domestic  The handling is very nimble   the ride is good  visiblilty is great   and the power is more then adequate considering that the ZTW is geared toward practical utility and not performence   For a station wagon   I find it comfortable and fun to drive The ZTW comes very well equiped with all the bells and whistles   Automatic   cruise   air   power doors and windows   CD player   heated seats and traction control   I think Ford throws this because of the tires  you need it  Instrumentation is very clear   good cargo space  more then the Jetta or the Forester which is surprising   Consumer Reports   Lots of little pockets etc Reliability was my major concern   but with a study of manufacturer recalls   government web sites   The Ford Focus has gone from nine recalls in 2000 when it was first introduced to nil  none   in 2003   Time will be the true test  but I feel Ford has most of the bugs worked out and the Focus has improved in the reliability department but this is a judgement call  Combined with price   I bought in Feb 2003 Ford has a rebate of  1 500 00 dollars for cash purchase and free moonroof with the purchase of the leather option amounting to almost  2 500 00 off the list price in Ontario  options  ride   comfort   the Ford Focus ZTW is great value for the money   I would recommend it   and would   at the present time   give it two thumbs up or four stars   
 Before this car I was never an SUV person or even cared much about cars  They just got me from A to B  But something about this one made me fall in love with it  I bought my Escape XLT in February and have loved every minute of it  The handling is great  just like a car  so you can zip around  brake  and corner smoothly  The 200 hp engine gives you plenty of acceleration  but you still get the roominess of an SUV  There is plenty of cargo space once you fold the seats down  which by the way fold completely flat  The mechanism for folding them does seem a little flimsy to the touch  but I ve had no problems  The interior on the XLT is great   don t get the XLS  The arm rest hides a huge storage space  and there are plenty of nooks and crannies for stuff up front  I splurged on the leather seats  sunroof  and in dash CD changer and I am so glad I did  The extras really make it more comfortable  and I am usually someone who likes to pinch pennies  If you are worried about wind noise  then don t get the sunroof  And have the dealer remove those ridiculous side step bars  they are just bolted on  Some minuses  Gas mileage isn t that great  hey  it s an SUV  not really meant for off roading  but I don t care  I live in the city  and some of the controls are a minor annoyance   the gear shift gets in the way of the radio and rear defrost button  and the ignition switch is in an odd place on the steering column All in all I love this car  Before  my boyfriend and I used to argue over who had to drive  Now I always volunteer  
 My former boss had one of these precious trucks and she let me drive it  Well  I am originally a Chevy only type but when i took off in this particular truck i feel in love with it The feature that i like the most are the third door and the bench seat in the front and back are so comfortable  Its like a couch We hauled around a dozen kids  a soccer team  all day from game to game and they said it a smooth ride  From the cab when we went over rail road tracks it was very smooth  I gotta have it br br  
 Having a family of 4 and the passion for travel  I wanted a large but comfortable vehicle  After test driving several SUVs I decided on the Expedition for several reasons  Foremost  I love the ride and handling  The Expedition can  quot turn on a dime quot  That s no joke  I have turned a complete circle within a three lane space  The steering is very easy  sitting still or moving it takes no effort to turn this vehicle  You can turn into a parking place with the ease of a smaller vehicle  Oh yes  it fits in a standard garage too  Another great feature I love and wouldn t know what to do without is the over head heating and cooling vents  The rear seat has its own control knobs making it easy for the kids to set their own temperature  One of my personal favorite features is the cup holders  4 in front  now how s that for a place to put your drinks  There is also two holders in the rear seats pull down arm rest  placed in the center of the seat very handy  And they didn t leave out the third seat  it too has cup holders placed on each side of the vehicle next to the window  Now for the power plant  I opted for the 5 4 liter Triton  I believe it s powerful enough to pull just about anything  Just out right performance it s quick and fast for a large vehicle  One of the very few things I m not quite satisfied with is the third seat option  It is very difficult to remove and I am 6 feet tall and weigh 200 lbs  so mom don t try to take the seat out by your self  It s heavy and very hard to handle  yet it s a nice thing to have  The fuel mileage is what you would expect out of a large vehicle bad  I get around 11 to13 in the city and 18 to 21 highway  Maintenance wise  we have had a few difficulties  There has been two recalls on this vehicle  one for the gas tank gage not reading accurately and one for the lug nuts coming lose  We experienced some noise problems when it was new  the front end bushings had cracked and were making an annoying squeaking sound  It took several trips to the garage before they fixed it  If I were to describe how this vehicle drives I would have to say GREAT  It s truly in the luxury class of SUVs  I have taken it on 1 600 mile trips with out being worn out  I would recommend this vehicle to the big and tall person  but a small person would feel right at home as well  My wife loves to drive it  at first she didn t think it would handle very easily  but after driving it the first time I had to beg her to give it back  I would have to give this SUV a big thumbs up     
 Why did I buy a 2000 GT Mustang well first I owned a 1969 Mach1 Mustang for the last 6 years and I can not tell you how much fun I had driving it This car made me a  quot king of the road quot People would stop traffic to let me out of parking lots parking spaces and even to exit driveways I think they just wanted to get a glimpse of American automotive history The Mustang is more than just a vehicle It is a symbol of who you are I love the way people would give me the thumbs up when they pulled up next to me or the stories they would share with me at car shows about their Mustangs that they owned or own They spoke about them as if they were a part of the family and that s how I felt about my old Mustang The most common phrase I hear is  quot I should never have gotten rid of my old Mustang quot  Well when it came time to purchase a new car I had plenty of choices but I knew I wouldn t be truly happy unless I was behind the wheel of my true love the Ford Mustang  As for driving one my test drive of the standard shift 2000 GT at the dealership was very pleasing The sound of the engine as I let the clutch out and drove out of first gear was so smooth and pleasing The power was on tap at all times Braking was excellent The all four disc brakes were a first time experience for me and I loved it The handling was quite nice Sharp turns were point and execute no questions asked I felt like the car was built around me in the drivers seat Everything was within reach Excellent view of the road front and rear  I can t wait for my new Mustang to arrive from the Dearborn Assembly plant I think I made the right choice Heck I know I made the right choice Mustangs are for anyone who wants fun performance and a little bit of American automotive history of their own As I tell all the Cheverolet lovers The STAMPEDE is louder than the HEARTBEAT br br  
 I purchased my 2000 Eclipse GS in January 2000  So far I have driven it 5000 miles and have not yet had a single mechanical problem  The 4 cylinder  which I purchased in a five speed  is sufficiently fast for general commuting  However  if you like to race  or show off to your friends  you will definitely want to go with the noticeably faster V 6 The physical appearance of the car is probably its greatest selling feature  There have been at least a dozen instances in which I have come out of a restaurant  or store and seen someone walking around my car and looking in the windows  countless other times I have received compliments about the way it looks My only real complaint is with a negative outcome of the physical styling  There is no body molding  Though it looks great  the drawback is that you have no protection against door dings  of which I already have two br br  
 I considered myself unlucky when I picked up a silver 2000 Chevy Malibu from Enterprise  In fact  I begged for a Corolla in its place  See  our rental Maxima had a flat  They replaced it with a 2000 Sebring Convertible which had an insane electrical system  So  all that they had for us was a Malibu  and I wasn t happy Why  Let s face it  It s cheap  Boring  And devoid of gadgets  Plus  I just don t like Chevy s  especially after a leather lined Sebring and a brand new Maxima After manually adjusting my cloth seat  I got ready to pull away  At first  I noticed how good the air conditioning was  even on a low setting  Then  I noticed the lack of unnecessary play in the wheel  Then  I hit the gas Wow Really  wow No  really  wow  This car was great It had power  power  power  Another reviewer here at Epinions said it better than I could he didn t time the 0 60 acceleration because there wasn t time step on the pedal  and  boom  you re at 60 mph  The steering was tight and responsive perfect  Easy to power around town  responsive enough to make stupid maneuvers in traffic doable  and a blast on 2 lane roads  The ride wasn t as smooth as a luxury car  but it didn t make my butt sore  The brakes were also up to the task the car stopped as fast as reasonably necessary  I didn t do anything too aggressive  Even better  as much as I hate automatic transmissions  it seemed to do a decent job of putting the car in the right gear to go the right speed it was innocuous  which is about the best that one can ask OK  you ll love driving it  but is it okay to sit in  I already mentioned the great A C  The cassette stereo was perfectly adequate for radio not great  but not horrible  It had RDS functionality which my wife had to read the owner s manual to figure out  if I cared about RDS  I would have needed to read a little as well  Cruise control engaged rapidly and crisply  The controls were standard GM issue lots of stalks which do lots of things in confusing fashions  The windshield washer stalk blocked the dashboard mounted ignition starting the car usually involved starting the windshield washers  which worked well when needed Seating position was great  The car felt tall  and the position seemed high  The manual cloth covered seats were adequate  but not something you d want to live in  I took the car for a 100 or so mile drive and they were fine  I m not sure that I d want to do a 500 mile day in them  though The front of the car was quite roomy more than enough room for my short legged 5 5  frame and my wife s beautiful and moderately long legged 5 4  frame  The rear looked like it would be fine for kids  and maybe for adults  but we didn t ever try it  There was a decent quantity of storage space in the cabin a dual level center console armrest  cup holders  door bins  and a big glove compartment So  what was wrong  Minor convenience and ergonomic issues  I already mentioned the stalk blocking the ignition  In addition  the car had automatic headlights which would turn on at the wrong times and turn off at the wrong time  or not at all  It would chirp or ding after being shut off for no good reason  Worst of all  turning the key in the driver s door didn t engage the power locks  and the power locks didn t seem to affect the driver side at all  Very annoying  While I m at it  If even the cheapest cars can have keyless entry  why not the Malibu  This shouldn t be an option any more  especially on a car with power windows  locks  and mirrors Would I buy one  No  The boring looks aren t really the problem  I wouldn t buy a Camry either  The problem is  you guessed it  GM s record for reliability  It s fun to drive  and very comfortable for the price  so I ll enjoy renting it again   for now  I just picked up a Seville which I like even better  Epinion to follow  
 My experience with my Toyota Camry has been nothing short of excellent  The Camry is the most reliable car I have ever owned  In all the time that I have had my Camry  I have never experienced any problems with how the car runs  It has never stalled on me  and always starts immediately  even in the coldest weather and even if has not been driven in awhile  I have spoken with many other Camry owners  and none have had any problems either  I have heard nothing but positive comments about this car  I have only had the car for 4 years now and I have not had to change my oil yet  The gas mileage is also good  The ride is extremely smooth  I have a tendency to speed because the ride is never bumpy   even at high speeds  The car is comfortable to ride in  It s not cramped and the seats are comfortable  The added features are all decent as well  The air conditioner and heater both work fairly quickly and the radio is good  My only complaint with the Camry is with the windows  The tend to fog up easily  especially in humid and rainy weather  They often take a while to defrost and the side windows can be nearly impossible to see out of at times     
 I have owned my 2000 Hyundai Tiburon since new  With 40 000 miles on it  it has proven to be trouble free  fun transportation  It is not the most powerful on the block  but where the Tib really shines is in the handling department  It s my understanding that Hyundai went to Porsche to get their suspension tuned for the Tiburon  and it shows  It handles very well in the snow as well My only gripe is the placement of the cupholder  which is a bit bizarre  It slides out from the radio console  so if you use it  you can t get easy access to the stereo controls Also  you can t beat the warranty with a stick  I have found the local Hyundai dealer to stand 100  behind this car  and the roadside assistance that comes with a new Hyundai is actually quite good  I locked my keys in the car  and called both AAA and Hyundai Roadside Assistance  The Hyundai people were there long before AAA was even on the way Considering how low priced the Hyundai Tiburon is vs  it s competition  and the quality of what you get  I think this car is hands down the best value among small sport coupes  
 I bought the Accord a week ago  Traded in a 2000 Camry LE  The Accord is more comfortable and responsive than the Camry So far the ride appears a little stiffer than the Camry but that may just be new car break in  The car goes where you steer it without the noticable roll and understeer of the Camry  It is a pleasure to drive  The four and the six cylinder is not much of a noticable different for a conservative driver like myself  I went for the four because it met my requirements The car looks good  I have the tan with leather and went for a few accessories such as the mud flaps  moon roof cover  trunk cargo kit  and the cassette player  Yes the cassette player is an option  The trunk cargo kit is a tray of plastic that fits the trunk like a bed liner in a pickup truck  Makes it easy to clean I was disenchanted by the Camry in terms of the driving comfort  The seats had no support  The Accord is another story  The seats have more contour and with the adjustments and bolsters you can find a perfect driving position  The heaters are a little slow but there is something to be said for having a warm seat on a cold winters day  Sort of therapeutic as well  The tranny shifts are unnoticable and smooth  The grade logic design also applies downshift on hills  Very smoooooth The cons I have are in comparision to the Camry  The door locks are on the back of the door instead of by the handle  It is more convenient to have the option of unlocking and opening the drivers door only  using one hand  On the Accord you need the right to unlock the door and the left to open it  More of an annoyance if you don t want to unlock all of the doors The front cup holders are very deep  It is not very condusive to picking up your medium coffee and drinking it without having to readjust your grip  There is also no cover over the cupholders when not in use The headlights do not turn on automatically  This is a safety concern  The dash panel is always illuminated  In fact it brightens up as the sensor on the dash notices that it is getting darker out  Eventually the thing is glowing lit  This confuses me into thinking that the headlights are on  NOT SO  They also don t auto off until 15 seconds after the car is turned off  I do not like this  feature  The the key and the speedometer are huge as well  Why so big The trunk lid is short  Nice styling but a bit of a problem for those of use who need to haul the trash cans to the dump every so often  The cans do not fit in the trunk standing up for the short trip  The older Accords and the Camry do not have this problem Overall I am pleased with my choice  I was comparing the 03 Camry  and used Acura TL and Lexus GS  In the end it comes down to Honda vs Toyota for most of us in the middle class  I ve had both and don t think that you can go wrong either way  This car is a very appealing to the family man that wants to keep the sporty side alive  It is still not the dream car but it is closer You have an awful lot of complaints about the car  considering you gave it five stars  The issues are more annoyances for me  I believe that most people can find annoyances in any car  As I said  not the dream car  but closer  Now on to the other stuff fit and finish I found the car exterior to be exceptional  On my Camry the gaskets on the windshield and rear glass were wavy  The trunk was slightly out of consistent tolerance  On the Accord the exterior is flawless  The interior has a wavy window gasket that looks like it was created by the dealer installed option on window vents  The rest of the interior is  frankly  very nice  I find no other flaws  interior noise level Compared to the Acura TL and the Camry I find the interior to be just as quiet  The OEM tires were overinflated on delivery  With the right tire pressure the ride is quiet  handling Handling is very responsive  The steering is responsive at slow or fast speeds  I find that the best brakes Braking appears to be good with little nose dive on strong braking pressure  rear seat The rear seat is a little lower than the Camry but the same as the TL  It has passed my daughter s inspection for loungability and leg room  trunk As I stated in my review the only flaw in the trunk is the lid length  The interior dimensions are adequate for the needs of this middle aged man  ergonomics The layout of the controls is actually quite convenient  The climate controls are easy to manipulate and adjust  The steering wheel mounted cruise and audio controls are very easy to use which allows the driver to pay attention to the road without distraction  UPDATE 6 10 03 The ride has smoothed out a bit  I thought it was a little firm at first and expected it to loosen up a bit with use  It did and it is still a joy to drive  Wish the steering wheel controls were lit at night  Sometimes change the channel instead of adjusting the volume and stuff like that Fold down rear seat is a must  If Acura gets with it they may have a chance on my next car  otherwise Honda is it  
 We were fed up with the cost of repairing our old camper van so we set out to lease a truck  The  99 F 150 series appealed to us with a solid build  reasonable cost  and great looks  We got our new truck off the lot and within the first 14 days the transmission blew  Apparently  someone hadn t installed a part properly  The warning lights came on first but the handbook did not direct us to stop driving   just recommended to get it in for servicing We ve had more trouble since  with those warning lights coming on without any other symptoms attached  The good news   we only have to keep the truck for three years and the problems are under warranty  The bad news   this truck spends as much time in the shop as our 20 year old camper van   it s hard to go camping when it breaks down  VERY DISAPPOINTING br br  
 Lyle Pakula Calgary  AB Ford Motor Company of Canada Limited The Canadian Road P O  Box 2000 Oakville  Ontario  Canada L6J 5E4 Advantage Ford Attn  General Manager 12800 Macleod Trail South Calgary  Alberta T2J 7E5 Marlborough Ford Sales Ltd Attn  General Manager 615   36 Street NE Calgary  Alberta T2A 4W3 November 29  2000 This letter clarifies my experience with Ford regarding my purchase of a 2000 Mustang GT  5 speed  VIN  1FAFP42X9YF154566  It has been forwarded to Ford Canada  Advantage Ford in Calgary  Alberta  where the vehicle was purchased  Marlborough Ford in Calgary  Alberta  where the car was serviced  the Consumer Report Online Forum  as well as the internet newsgroups In February of this year my wife and I purchased a 2000 Mustang GT from Advantage Ford  in Calgary  Alberta  Canada  The salesmen were great  They answered all our questions  and explained the car fully  After the sale  the experience on this car slowly spiraled downward  When we purchased our GM vehicle  the salesman  as well as the business manager  called me once a week for a month to ensure I was absolutely satisfied with our purchase  I think we may have received a single call from our salesman at Ford When we went to pick the car up  they had forgot to tint the windows  as per the deal  Even though it was pre paid  I had to go out of my way to take the car to the tint shop to have it done  The car itself is very sharp looking  The body is sound  the exterior construction is top notch  The doors don t rattle when slammed  and we were very impressed  The 4 6 liter engine has a lot of power in the upper RPM ranges  but is quite gutless at the lower RPM s  Any shifts that aren t made very high in the RPM band  place the engine in a band that it has very little power  The transmission isn t bad  but my 1967 Corvette had a way better gearbox  The solid rear axle causes the back of the vehicle to side skip dangerously if a the tires hit a break in the pavement on a corner  This occurs even at slow speed  The steering wheel lock is only on 180 degree intervals  What good is that  If you do get the wheel to lock when the rack and pinion is hot  it s almost impossible to remove the pressure from the ignition tumbler when the rack and pinion is cold  My wife s 1989 Mustang GT had the same problem  The interior of the car offers little to be desired  The leather upgrade only affects the front buckets  The back seat is covered in vinyl  The front buckets are very uncomfortable to sit in  They have no lumbar and no heat  Long journeys in this car are almost painful  In the winter  the car feels drafty and cold  Turning up the blower fixes the heat problem  you just can t hear yourself think over roar of the blower  The blower on low speeds has a very annoying squeak  My friends 1995 Mustang GT coupe has the same annoying squeak  Five years  and the problem is still there  The interior is cheap grade plastic  Many areas on the car have pieces of plastic extrusion that still weren t cleaned off before the car was assembled  The map pockets on the doors have sharp plastic edges  and no inserts to make them look finished  The whole interior probably cost Ford  50 to build All bitching aside  the car itself was a welcome addition to our family  until the problems started  At 5500 km  the transmission exhibited a problem where changing from reverse to first gear caused the transmission to lock up  Disengaging the clutch caused grinding of gears  After working the gear shift for about fifteen minutes  the transmission would free itself  After complaining to the service manager at Marlborough Ford  he agreed to swap the transmission  as there was a TSB on this problem    At 9000 km it developed an exhaust leak  At 12000 km it started to randomly stall when coasting to a light  It went into the shop  and they found the low speed cooling fan wasn t connected  and they suspected the load from the high speed fan was stalling the engine  Returned to the shop because it continued to stall  No fault found  Returned to Advantage Ford  where they re programmed the ECU to eliminate the stalling problem  It hasn t stalled as of yet  but the weather has changed  At 12500 km returned to the shop for a thumping noise in the transmission when changing gears  I m told this horrible sound is  quot normal quot  Returned the next day for a seizing release bearing in the clutch assembly  The whole clutch was replaced at this point  Still waiting on the re call for the parking brake  No big deal  the car really doesn t need to stop The service at Marlborough Ford was great  They were tired of seeing me  but they always treated me with respect  My only complaint was they lack the extra little care  Not once did the car come from the shop clean  When our GM product came from the shop  it had been washed  In the land of Ford  the policy is  quot Dirty in  Dirty out quot  Upset with the problems this car has caused us  I called the Ford Customer Care Center  It took four  4  calls to the center over a period of eight  8  days to actually get an answer about the car  I finally got to speak to someone who would give me an answer  and the answer was  quot Ford sells the car to the dealer  the dealer sells to the consumer  Ford will do nothing for you  as it is between the dealer and you quot  Thanks Ford  Your product is substandard  your customer care is substandard  and your attitude towards the consumer is substandard  I ve yet to receive a survey regarding the service done at Marlborough Ford  Ford  aren t you supposed to follow up on work done for your customers Leaving me with no options  I returned to Advantage Ford to see what they could do for me  I was basically told all the problems from the car stemmed from the initial transmission swap by Marlborough Ford  They were prepared to do nothing but continue to try to bring my level of confidence up on the car  Once a lemon  always a lemon in my books So to summarize  Don t bother calling for Customer Care  They will do nothing for you  They don t care at all  They really should change their number from 1 800 565 FORD to 1 800 FORD SUX  As much as the initial sale at Advantage Ford was great  they don t stand behind their product  They were more willing to pass the buck than look after my needs  The service at Marlborough Ford was great  But  according to Advantage Ford  their mechanics were negligent in repairing my vehicle  You be the judge So  after losing all confidence in the car  this was my wife s car  we decided to trade it on an Acura CL Type S  This will be the last blue oval that will be parked in my garage  So here is an estimated summary in what this car has cost me 10000 Lost due to depreciation on the trade 2500 Usage for the 13000 km on the vehicle  as per CAMVAP calculations 50 Missed time at work to take care of the window tinting  which was part of the deal 50 Gas burnt while the car was in the shop  75 litres    0 65   litre 170 Missed day of work for my wife when the transmission piled up in the back alley 200 Cumulative missed time at work for me to deal with the car in the shop Total   7970  So Ford  when can I expect my check in the mail   quot Ford Quality is Job One quot  I doubt it  If this is the quality level of your service and product  then I guess I was the fool for buying your product Another Unsatisfied Customer Lyle Pakula br br  
 I just graduated from college last May  and I had been saving money to replace my Ford Taurus station wagon when I set out to buy my first new car  I was looking at all the small sedan models  I tried out the Focus and I loved it  I bought it that day I really love the compactness of this car  although the interior is large enough for my 6 1 quot  boyfriend  Its really sporty  and fun to drive  The only feature that is even a little annoying are the headrests  which can be hard to see around when changing lanes  The ride is very smooth and quiet  and the radio booms  I like to crank up the bass  The driver controls are handy and sleek Probably most importantly  I feel safe in this car  It doesn t feel like its made of plastic and is being blown around in the wind  I bought the car in January  in a bad Ohio winter  and felt very safe The financing even worked out well for me  with my first year salary  If you are young  or want to feel young again  you should be driving this car br br  
 Although I do not own this particular vehicle  I have had the opportunity to drive the Durango  plenty of times  I found that the Durango is a very good 4x4 vehicle  as it took me up the fire breaks at Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base in southern California  The Durango only had a problem when the hard ground gave way to thick dust  that just about reached the bottom of the door  coupled with the fact that the fire break began a very steep incline  Durango has a lot of cargo room  at first seems somewhat small but this is deceiving and to my surprise it s very spacious  The group I was with in California found that we could pack more equipment in the Durango than in another suv by a significant amount  In fact we hauled over 15 bags  50 pounds each  of concrete  all the hand tools for digging holes  post hole digger  breaking bar  etc  thirty 1 2 quot x18 quot  rebar  and our surveying equipment  with no problems or loss of power  The gear was also easily  and readily accessible  The power of this truck is never an issue  with it s 306 cu  in  power plant  the Durango has plenty of get up and go  And with three engines to choose from  the 306 is the  quot mid quot  sized engine  you can pick your power needs  If you are considering to buy a suv then look no further than a Durango  and that is if you are looking for a vehicle that can take you just about anywhere you want or need go  and looks good clean or dirty  You may consider another vehicle though if you are looking for a convertible  they don t make them  yet br br  
 Purchased this car in July of 1997  I loved this car  Of all the cars I have ever owned  it was a favorite  Its manufacture date was 10 96  so it had been in inventory for a while  so got a good deal  The MSRP was 24 350  If looking around  keep in mind that the LX was top of the line for 86 98  In 99 current  it is the base model   What was Ford marketing thinking  I liked the design of this auto  contrary to public opinion  It had all options except sunroof  The DOHC 3 0 V 6 ran really smooth  In 97 it was rated at 200hp  It was quite  rode well  tight body  and had no squeaks  The reliability was great  We never had any problems with the car  We had to sell it to my aunt when our family exceeded five  She still owns it and loves it  My wife s heart sinks whenever she sees it  Great car  You can get a slightly used one for a great price due to the fact that Ford has flooded the market with this automobile br br  
 I bought this vehicle in Dallas  Texas in 1998 after purchasing an 850 GLT 1996 wagon two years earlier  I loved my first volvo  and it is at 56 000 miles now and has not yet been in the shop for anything but routine maintanance  The 1998 Volvo is an S90 SE  which is the top model but with a special woodtrim piece on the steering wheel and tweeters built in to the panal between the front and rear doors  It is rear wheel drive  and was discontinued in  99  I bought mine for  28K since it was on sale  but the retail was quite higher  Two weeks before I moved to Iowa I had starting problems  The dealership put in a new battery and it was loaded on the car carrier a few days later  appearing to be fixed  When I got it off the carrier it would start only once every 10 minutes   ex  if u turned it off you would have to wait 10 minutes or more to start it again  as well as the winter mode dash light blinking on and off  and the driver s power seat not functioning at all  It has yet to be fixed  and the nearest dealership is a couple hours away  When the dealership gets it fixed I may sell it  because it gets stuck in the driveway  I may as well park it in the garage until spring  However  I will score this car omitting the rare problem I occured and assuming I still lived in Texas  where it performed with excellence  It is safe  comfortable  quiet  and has many unique features that makes it a great family car  It is a vehicle that has elegance and is up there with Lexes  Saab  BMW  and Mercedes  Any person living in a warm climate with or without a family would enjoy this vehicle br br  
 I received a  95 Ford Mustang as a gift on my 16th birthday  I picked this specific car because it was a fun  stylish  and sporty vehicle that was affordable enough for a first car  My family definitely got it s money s worth  I ve been driving this car for five years and the only problem it has had with the mechanics on the car is the alignment got slightly off track  Inside the car is a different story  The makers of this car did not do a perfect job gluing in the accessories  In the last year  the interior door molding  where the handle is  came unglued and came off the door  Also  the hook that holds the visor came off  Finally  the paneling by the radio  air conditioning  and stick shift has started to peel  Other than that  everything else is in tack  The air conditioning has never had a problem  It drives really smooth  and it corners very well  The pickup as it changes gears is quick and smooth  I love driving the Ford Mustang and hope to trade it in the future for a 2000 Mustang   or maybe a newer one than that br br  
 My wife recently leased a 2001 Mercury Sable  She traded in her 1996 Ford Probe  We have a 10 week old and the Probe was not practical The Sable is a solid car  I was quite impressed with the 24V DOHC engine   it really moves  The car was pleasingly quiet inside and had good room  We are able to comfortably put the car seat in and out of the back  and 2 additional adults can sit in the back with the car seat as well I ll say it again  the car does move  It handles great and steers well  It is a pleasure to drive  I really like the thick steering wheel on the car She got a fantastic deal on a lease  She put no money down and is only paying around  350 a month for a 3 year lease  The car is an incredible value However  this value comes at a cost  I m not a big fan of the interior  It s functional  but just plain  Mercury could have done a lot better  It looks outdated  It feels about 3 years out of date compared to similar models form other companies Common features like dual climate control are absent on the vehicle  It seems as if they cut their design time just a bit early on the vehicle  With a bit more time it could really be refined and made a world class sedan I m not a big fan of the seats either  leather seats  They re not very contoured and aren t the very comfortable However  given what we paid for it and its 5 Star Crash Rating it s really hard to beat  I d suggest taking one for a good test drive   if you like it chances are you won t find a better value out there  
    Innovation  Design and One Small Engine    Honda created and designed the Honda Insight by 1998 and had it successfully prototyped by then  By the year 2000 it was stocked and became an arm  and a success of Honda 146s The Insight is a fine example of the innovational ideals of Honda  Honda makes they 146re prints 133  small  sturdy  cheap and of course some exquisite gas mileage abilities    And what do you get when you take this up the next level  Well  you get the Honda Insight of course  It is what you could call the super car of its time  The true gas mileage would be unbelievable and impossible if it were not for the Hybrid Engine with it 146s IMA system  and feather design  Honda 146s method to achieving this car was more or less like this 133 Input   Light Weight  Efficient  Strong  147but 148 simple Hybrid engine Clean Effective recharge of battery while in use An effective IMA  Integrated Motor Assist The IMA is also a key limb in making sure fuel consumption is at its maximum conservation Meaning the IMA will attempt to control gas usage in all situations  such as braking  idling or other instances when gas would be wasted  All though the amount of gas that is actually saved is petty  but still decent  it is what makes the Honda Insight the lowest fuel consuming car in the world   Output The Honda Insight The Honda Insight was made to be fuel conservative  All parts were made for durability  while maintaining their properties  and for their lightweight structure b  Engine Performance  Design  Quality   Small 133the engine  the actual v 3 engine  is very small  It is a 1 0 liter VTEC Engine  that doesn 146t pack a punch  It can move the car  just enough  that you can barely make it to speeds that are legal on the highways But with smaller engines  come higher gas mileage  better gas mileage I mean  So with a smaller engine you won 146t have to go stop at your local gas station  stock up  and come back the next day  Gas is expensive  that is how it will always be  Prices will change better of for worse  but in the end  you probably are going to be spending over a few thousand dollars on gasoline every year So with the Honda Insight comes a new possibility of change  in your wallet  No more going to the gas station everyday which  some of you out there who have SUV 146s would understand  I am not blaming down SUV 146s  I own one and am happy with it 133but I praise my Honda Insight  So will you sacrifice power  for distance 133  Of Course  who wouldn 146t If you aren 146t swimming in cash  but you would like some  the Honda Insight is a good investment that will pay for itself after time  And how does this little car pay for itself  Well it 146s in its little Hybrid Engine  The process is somewhat like this 133 You start the car  150 147electric 148 You drive the car down your street to get to some ramp leading to an Interstate Highway  150 147gas 148 You get on the Highway maintain a steady speed  147gas electric 148 You get off the car continues to switch back and forth  or use both halves of the engine  to get the maximum gas mileage That is a blunt example of how the Insight works and saves you  your money  What you just saw plainly was a system inside the car called  147the IMA system 148 It is a fuel conserving system that will consider and decide what percentile of the engine it should use to minimize fuel burning  The IMA system will actually be controlling the engine more than you will  It will decide when certain things click on  and off  to make sure you aren 146t running the IMA system just to get to your local gas station Also the 1 0 liter 12 valve SOHC VTEC  150E 3 Cylinder engine is made of some of the lightest parts available  Mostly because it doesn 146t matter how small the engine is  even though small engines usually are light  it matters if you have a light engine  They made the engine light enough so carrying itself would not be a task while carrying it 146s passengers as well Actually the entire car is made out of sturdy lightweight parts  I mean they made the gas tank plastic  durable plastic of course no worries for you mate  do release so weight towards the rear of the car  Just don 146t be skittish at the point that the car is made out to be light  because everything is of good quality and 133that I believe will bring me to safety b  Safety   yes  it was designed for collisions as well   Well  actually I may be contradicting my heading but 133nothing is really designed for collisions But things are designed to be safe in a collision  and that is what the Insight was designed for  The Insight has light parts yes  but can still handle fine in a head on collision  or even avoid one  The Insight has anti lock brakes  which will make some quick  non planned stops  And the Insight alone is made light  so if you remember Newton 146s 133I think  second law  It states the law of Inertia  wait I can 146t remember  maybe it wasn 146t even Newton  maybe it was just the law of Inertia  And if you know what Inertia is then you 146ll know that this car can stop pretty fast  Inertia  The more mass an object has the more of a tendency it has to keep going the same direction  and the more mass an object has at rest the more of a tendency it will have to stay at rest  Well  to this bluntly  you can stop a go kart fast because it 146s light  you can 146t stop a tractor trailer as quickly  ever notice those runaway truck stops for semi 146s that burn away their brakes So  another thing that might have clouded you mind  or make you want to turn away from the Insight 133is gone So their you have it  the Insight is safe ish  You 146ve got air bags  and you 146ve got one light car to drive circles around drunk drivers  And you may not take the safety seriously but I mean it  the Honda Insight is made and certified with some of the World 146s highest collision safety standards b  Handling   Anything light in my opinion handles like a breeze  The Honda Insight has an aluminum frame and is low riding to the ground to reduce roll  and wind flow underneath the car  This makes the car feel to you as if the car were hugging the road  providing stability and control Honestly  the car handles like a Honda  What do I mean by this  Well the car is light  low to the ground and aerodynamic  So you really won 146t find any flaws with the car 146s handling  or run into any convenience factors  Like  this car will fit into every car garage  as long as it isn 146t matchbox size  and will be able to park itself in tight spots with room to spare  And yes getting into those small parking spaces is a breeze So handling  is very hard to touch since  it handles so well all I can say is 133 it handles like a Honda  So there you have it 133   The Exterior Interior   The Honda Insight was made with a smooth sleet exterior design not for looks  but for increased aerodynamics and less wind resistance  But nonetheless  the Insight has a sleek exterior  If you 146re wondering what types of optional add on 146s there are for this car 133well there is no need to ask because there are none  Yes  I mean it  there are no extra options you can add to this car  Why  I would believe because Honda has made a standard of everything in the Insight so all models have the same resulting gas mileage and performance So exterior is as you would see it  But Interior can 146t be the same right  Well actually there isn 146t anything else to add 133no moon roof  cheap gizmo 146s or some extra gauges  Everything is standard in the Insight  you choose your limited interior selections and that 146s it  This is a positive trait to some  to others it 146s slightly dull  But at least when you have a car that standards everything  you won 146t have to worry about getting crap  and all the good stuff is optional My interior is as simple as it could be  All black on dashboard  and all black on the seats  well to be completely accurate  the middle of my seats are burnt gray  nothing special as you can see  I 146m afraid of color The Interior won 146t need any spicing up either  they 146re enough valves  gauges  and switches to make the car look modernized enough  Even though I said the car is made to be light 133by no means did I mean the car was stripped down  actually it 146s the opposite So  very much like Honda their isn 146t a lot of things for you to choose  which makes some people feel they are being limited  but I just think why have options that you won 146t even choose  but you 146ll find another reason of appeal from the car And yes the seats are comfortable  well I can 146t believe how the only two seats in the car would be uncomfortable  So don 146t worry about long road trips b i  Mine O My Limited Options    Well the following are my options 133but they are all standard  so what I have is what you can expect  just to let you know b Options  i ABS Anti Lock Brakes Dual Front Airbags  SRS Dual Side Impact Door Beams Power Windows 12 Volt Accessory Outlet AM FM Cassette Audio System Climate Control AC i Just your average options as you plainly can see  But just so I can say I told you this  I 146ll tell you the exterior features Dual Power Mirrors Impact Absorbing Bumpers Remote Entry System Rear Window Washer 14 148 Lightweight Alloy Wheels b  Did I mention that it 146s the world 146s most fuel efficient car    It doesn 146t get better than this 133this is the world 146s most fuel efficient car in the world  So if you want to get a car that 146s fuel efficient and you don 146t need to seat more than 2 people  Well than this is your car  Trust me  if you love spending money as much as you like saving it 133this is the car to get i I hope this review was helpful to you 133  Another great Honda Car

 I won t go through the history of the Civic  or its place in modern driving with you  We have all seen the popularity of the Civic grow with each passing year  as shown by looking out your car s windshield and seeing so many of them on the road  The 2000 Civic is as durable as any other year I have yet had the pleasure of driving  with smooth handling and ride In one review  I noticed mention of tire squeal in turns  and have to say that I haven t noticed it myself  My girlfriend s Civic handles beautifully in the corners and sharp turns in our area  and has yet to produce tire squeal  This may be a problem indicative to the type of road surface in your area  and not a design flaw  The stopping power of the Civic is in some question  and is variant upon weather  which in South Florida  is nasty in the rain   Then again  in the rain  what does stop well For speed and performance  the Civic  even the sportier models  is an economy car  not a sports car  If you are looking for true speed  get the V6 equipped Accord  or better yet  the Prelude  depending on you passenger and cargo needs  Honda does wonders with a 1 5L 4 cylinder  but there is only so much so small and engine can do  If your need is for speed  you re looking in the wrong place  If you want reliability  comfort  economy and safety  at a reasonable price  then the Civic was made for you br br  
 It s really funny how the mind works  You think of one little thing and discuss it with your life partner and that one little thought turns into a tangent of all kinds of thought processes  On this warm and sunny Saturday we got into the car and headed for Benicia CA  Benicia is the port of entry for the Kia s coming to the United States from Korea  Frankly it was quite a sight driving down to the shoreline and seeing literally thousands of Kias still wrapped in their protective coverings  By far the more spectacular picture was the decommissioned naval vessels right behind the hundreds of acres of Kias  Now this is what led to the thought processes that followed First of all I vividly remember the ghost fleet as I was traveling in the bay area as a young teenager  I remember rows and rows of these ships  Now there is a significantly less amount  Where in the heck did all our big beautiful ships go  This is where my husband  George tells me a good deal were sold as scrap metal  Then I wondered to myself if any part of these ships could have been made into these Kias I was looking at  We had our binoculars to see if we could spot the ship my husband had been on when he was in the Navy  It had been the USS Twining  The Twining wasn t included amongst the rows of old naval vessels  We pondered all the way home from Benicia what had happened to that ship  Thanks to the whole new world at our fingertips we were able to easily find out  The USS Twining had been decommissioned in July of 1971 and was transferred to the navy of Taiwan and renamed the Kwei Yang  It s good to know that this old destroyer hasn t been made into a soda can or a Kia On our quest to find a vehicle to tow our boat and since we were shopping on the Kia lot anyway for my daughter s first new car we thought we d test a 2001 Kia Sportage  It was an off roader I had never taken seriously  but perhaps I should have  In 1995 it raced the Baja 1000 and won its class  For two years in a row it was class champion in the Laughlin SCORE Desert Series  The Kia warranty I find so impressive 10 year 100 000 miles does give it credibility  With the threat of gasoline prices climbing into the three dollar a gallon range we feel we certainly must take fuel economy into consideration  The Kia Sportage 4x4 is right around 20 22 with the manual transmission  But we are sure we want the automatic transmission  which gets a little less at 19 22  The fuel tank holds 15 8 gallons of fuel  That would get us at least 350 miles between fuel stops  With 125 7 cubic interior space it felt pretty roomy though I m sure not much of that was designated to the backseat  Though in all fairness the rear legroom in the Sportage is 31 1 in  But with my long legs it just didn t seem big enough  But can it tow  Nope  No more than our Saturn can tow  1000 lbs  Though there is a rumor floating around that Kia is going to come out with a V6 that can tow 2500 lbs  Now that would fit the bill nicely  If the trailer to be towed had an independent braking system then the Sportage can tow 2000 lbs Since we re on the subject of brakes the Sportage has dual circuit hydraulic  power assisted vacuum braking systems  The front brakes are 11 1  inch vented discs and the rear 10 2 inch cast iron drum with dual lower assisted vacuum  There is an optional antilock braking system On the other models of Kias  the Sephia  Spectra  Rio and Optima the engines and transmissions were made in Korea  On the Sportage the transmissions came from Japan and the engines from Korea   07  of the parts came from the US and Canada  The finally assembly point is WHA Sung Gun Korea The base price of the 4x4 Sportage was  16 795  which is significantly less than most other SUVs  If you re looking for a vehicle for off road fun this could very well be the SUV for you  The Toyota 4Runner SR5 4WD Automatic is  29 355  That folks is a  12 560 difference and I m sure they both can equally get just as down and dirty  I just got a brochure in the mail today from our salesperson Carlos Oliveira from Geweke Kia in Lodi CA with  2 500 discount on the 2001 Sportages  They also have an additional Geweke discount of  200 00 on any used or new vehicle There are so many other things to consider before purchasing a new vehicle  How about the insurance costs  Heck  I don t want to own a new car just to find out I can t afford to drive it anywhere because the insurance is outrageous  Now this is where we run into a very bump in the road on the Kia Sportage  This information is taken from The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  It is a comparison of different insurance cost between different vehicles of the same class  It represents the vehicles  collision loss experience and on the table 100 is average  So say the rating is 122 this represents a collision loss experience that is 22 percent higher  that is worse  than the average  So lower is better and higher is worse The following vehicles are all in the small utility vehicle class and the average for small utility is 90  The Honda CR V 4 dr 4 WD is 72  the Jeep Cherokee 4 dr 4 WD is 99  the Kia Sportage 4 dr 4 WD is 113 and the Suzuki Grand Vitara 4 dr 4 WD is 117  I choose all 4 door and 4 wheel drive for this comparison to be fair  The Kia Sportage 4 dr 4 WD rated at 113 third down on my lists of comparisons  This tells me I might need to consider other SUV s because of insurance cost  Though if you consider the extreme difference in cost between the Sportage and other small SUV s I don t think a couple hundred dollars or so in extra insurance comes near paying almost double the cost for a different SUV  Also you have to consider the potential savings because of the given 10 100 000 warranty on the Sportage compare to the standard 3 36 000  Of course you can purchase an extended warranty on other SUV s but the Sportage s warranty is part of the whole package  I m still waiting not so patiently for the new Saturn SUV to come out in the fall  One of our fellow Epinionaters  thanks mkaresh   emailed me and told me this Saturn will be able to tow 2500 lbs  so this will be plenty sufficient to tow a boat Lets take a look at some of the options that will be added on to the  16 795  We no doubt want the 4 speed automatic transmission  this will be  1000 00  We oldies but goodies really need our air conditioning  To keep cool we ll have to add another  900 00  The rear wiper would be nice at  125 00  We might as well have the AM FM Stereo CD Player for  475  And heck lets get a roof rack for  195 00  You never tell when one might come in handy  Now we add freight and handling for an additional  450 00  I went and watched this handling personally at Benicia and it is a process I really have never taken into consideration before  Who has to take off all that neat little wrapping papers  Hmm When looking at the insurance cost difference I was kind of wondering if I compared the fuel mileage costs if this would offset the additional insurance costs  The Honda CR V 4 door  4 WD is a 2 0l 4 cylinder engine and gets 22 city and 25 highway  Suzuki Grand Vitara 4 door  4 WD is a 2 5l 6 cylinder engine and gets 18 city and 20 highway  The Jeep Cherokee 4 door  4 WD is a 4 0l 6 cylinder engine and gets 15 city and 20 highway  Just for the kick of it let s throw in the Toyota 4Runner 4 WD with a 3 4l 6 cylinder engine at 16 city and 19 highway  The Sportage ranks right up there around 20 22  losing some power because of the 4 cylinder engine but I sure didn t notice any significant degree of power loss There are lots of models to choose from  They have a darling little 2 door convertible Sportage with either 4x2 or 4x4  There is the Sportage 2 door and Sportage 4 door  The Sportage EX  Base or the Sportage Limited available in either 4x2 or 4x4 I guess what it boils down to is many questions and factors  How important to your image is the vehicle you drive  Some people measure success in different ways  Do you want something with an outstanding warranty  Or do you want to pay extra for an extended warranty  How much power are you going to need  Or is decent gas mileage worth giving up a small amount of power  What kind of towing capacity do you need  I m sure there are at least a thousand and one more questions you ask yourself before you buy a car  One more question I m sure many people ask themselves who and how big is the person that has to ride in the backseat This 130 horsepower 16 valve dual overhead cam engine  double wishbone front suspension maybe the vehicle for you  At least I have helped you determine that it is certainly worth looking at and test driving  
 I owned a 1997 V6 Mustang that I was very proud of until a person I work with bought a 1995 twin turbo Supra  Before that  I could easily keep up with his Mitsubishi 3000GT  but now he simply played with me  Previously  I had thought about the Cobra  but for the money  I did not feel I was getting my money s worth  Until 2003  I read the reviews and finally decided to test one  I traded my 97 for the 03 Cobra on the spot Now  the Supra guy trembles when he hears me coming  The whine of my supercharger can only be described as primordial  I have not lost a street race yet  and that is with the car still stock from the lot  Look at the numbers and you will know what I am talking about  I have a conservative 380 horses under the hood and pushing around 400 lbs ft torque When you really get down to it  if you are reading this review you want to know if a TRUE American muscle car can beat the rice burners out on the street  I can unequivocally tell you  it will eat those for breakfast on the straights and in the curves  This baby hugs the road  I was like you and wondered if it would be worth it  Don t hesitate  Buy it  You will not regret it I only have one suggestion for Ford on the Cobra  The interior reminds me too much of my 1997  I would like to see the interior updated  I would like to personally see the baby loaded with electronics instead of analog controls  
 Well when I was test driving trucks I drove several late model compact pickups before finally decided on my 95 Ranger XLT  One of them is another Ranger  a stripped Base model I found on the same lot  At first  my parents thought  cheap  low mileage  let s go for it  So I had a closer look  This was a stripped  and I mean totally stripped  base model  No air  no tape deck  vinyl flat bench  manual everything  dough nut looking little tires  and that was pretty much it  There wasn t even any power steering  This was a barest of the bare bones models  designed to be a work vehicle  It seems like little trucklets like this one are the ones predestined from the factory to become those rough running 200 000 mile little rust buckets with springs that sag from constant overloading But my parents liked the price so I gave it a quick test drive  Well  what can I say about the interior on this truck  Well  it s a place where you sit  The vinyl floor isn t particularly attractive  so if you like quality looking materials look elsewhere  but it should be easy to hose out after muddy boots have made their mark  The numbers on the gauges are nice and easy to read  with the steering wheel made so the spokes do not block the view of the panel  The controls are simple  large  and easy to read  probably because there are no options so you don t have that many to clutter up the dash  The dash is the older square shape  before the interior was redesigned a couple years later  The plain  flat  rectangle and square shapes do not bulge and curve like the dashboards on later models  so everything is moved a bit farther away from the driver s reach and I found I had to look down more to operate the radio and heat controls  I missed the center armrest that usually makes it easy to rest your elbow while your hand works the controls  Did I mention no air  Or no tape deck  The am fm radio was tinny and fuzzy  But good enough to break up the monotony of lunch break at the construction site By the way I see more XLT s at work sites than strippers by far  Maybe even working men like their creature comforts The flat vinyl bench was  well  a place to rest your rear end  Not much more  Not designed for hours of comfortable cruising  just plain functional  There were also no headrests  which I find unforgivable in even the most stripped pickup made in the 90 s Then there was that power steering  Wait  no  I m confusing this with post stone age models  There was none  I ll admit  that s one less thing that might eventually break or require extra maintenance  but me and my parents ended up deciding it was worth it  Just try turning the wheel for the first ten seconds or so after start up before you get going and the steering warms up and effort gets lighter  I dare ya  With trucks like this who needs to lift weights  Just try maneuvering through a tight parking lot and you can get all the workout you need Handling was what could be expected with such a basic suspension setup  This truck sits low and is stiffly spung so it leans a little less that you might expect  but those puny 195 millimeter wide tires give out fast  And those leaf springs with a solid rear axle make for a nice dance number in bumpy corners  Ride damping was  well  truck like  Small bumps close together made it dance  The bigger ones were actually absorbed fairly well  just a solid  wump  with the suspension taking a good bit of the punishment before it reached the passengers  Of course  the really big pot holes gave me a headache  Sound deadening was probably another area where Ford did a little skimping  as the engine noise was ever present The little 2 3 4 banger does its job well in my truck  and in this truck it has considerably less weight to pull so I never felt like it lacked power  Merging into street traffic was pretty easy with the 145 lb feet of low end torque that motivates what must be a sub 3000 pound truck  Highway merging or passing are a different matter all together  You can do it  you just have to thrash this truck at 3000 rpm or maybe a little more  where it starts to get coarse and boomy  I don t recommend shifting below fourth at those speeds  but it gets tempting as it only pulls in 5th in ideal conditions and it only pulls in fourth over about 70 mph All in all  a work truck and no more  It does not presume to be a commuter vehicle or a highway cruiser  It is a work vehicle  to be used and abused until it falls apart  which should take quite awhile because of the lack of fancy extras or electronics that may be likely to develop problems in the future  If you absolutely have to have a truck and it s all you can afford go for it  with the reminder that this vehicle will not be much fun as a daily driver  Best left to those who need a reliable work horse OK maybe more like a work pony  and don t care about any options or frills  Me  I m quite happy that we paid a little more for my 95 XLT with 60 40 split bench and center console  tape deck  and rear sliding window  I strongly advise using some of the money saved by ordering the most basic power train and suspension for interior upgrades br br  
 I have been looking for many years for a truck that will stand out from all others  I have found it  Ford has made many models and sold millions  I went to the Ford Dealership where I live and I was shopping for a truck and as I walked into the show room there it was  This truck was the big foot of all  Custom style with all the extra  This truck was made to stay in the showroom and their was not one other was like this one  I then looked it over and it had all I wanted and I was sold  I test driven  and I was surprised that this truck was made for me  I seen trucks of the same model on the lot and this one was made special  Large tires with mag s  California Concept detailing  I said to the sale man  I ll take it  There was group of people there wanting to take this truck out of the showroom and was told its sold  If I would of walked away and went on looking elsewhere it would of been gone  People come up to me and ask where did you get your truck  Its one of a kind custom made  Rear Cab is custom with closure of the body color and lock  Not with cab liner as most truck  This make more safe when traveling and packing all your extra in the rear  California Concept is a company that specializing in detailing with all the extra as tires and shields and medal steps side for that sporty look  If you go and look for a truck of this kind ask the dealership for information about California Concept  and then you will have a truck you will love  
  UPDATE ON REVIEW STILL GOING STRONG AT 115 000 MILES AND 3 YEARS LATER END OF UPDATE I ve had my F150 for over a year now  I bought the truck used with 48 000 miles on it  one owner  I currently have 82 000 miles  It s a very dependable truck in some ways  but a hassle in other ways SPECS 1996 Ford F150 XL Regular Cab 300 6 Cylinder  Manual Transmission Long Wheel Base  Dual Gas Tanks PROS 1  The truck can pull just about anything 2  It drives excellent  no shakes or rattles 3  Parts are inexpensive and easy to find at any local parts store 4  The interior is comfortable  I have cloth seats and carpet flooring 5  The stereo system sounds great  two front speakers and two rear 6  Insurance rates are low 7  It s easy to work on  if you are mechanically inclined  lots of room under the hood CONS 1  One of the pulleys for the belt has a tendency to become worn and make an awful sound  it has to be replaced  cost about  15 2  It guzzles gas  About 14 15 miles per gallon  There are two tanks on mine  but they don t get me very far 3  The brakes had to be replaced at 50 000 miles  now my rims are always covered with brake dust Yes  there are more pros than cons  but the gas guzzling counts as more than one con If your looking for a dependable used truck this is the one  but take the gas mileage into consideration before making a decision  
 I love this truck  After minivans  full size Blazers  small SUVs and Explorers  finally our family has an SUV to fit us all in comfort  and carry my tools  Actually stretching legs in the back seat  with lots of WIDTH  5 King size adults are comfortable We have the 4 6 V8  I think the mpg is great for the weight  14 mpg for 5800 lbs  real world driving  I laugh at others who are driving 2500 lb cars  cramped up  getting 22 mpg  When gas goes back up to  2 3 gallon  they will laugh  Ford truck reliable  I like the fact that the seats fold down for cargo  It really is huge  almost a fullsize van  No more humping mini van seats into the garage  It is tall  You have to be prepared to know exactly the height for city and mall garage parking  And even when using the mirrors  small cars are hard to see when backing up  merging  or changing lanes  so be careful  Especially when being passed on the right  common in NY NJ  even though they are breaking the law  They move right over to that shoulder  kind of like gnats  I haven t taken it off road much yet  Soon  But curbs are no problem  I can see how people roll these  but you have to be going over 40 mph and making a pretty sharp turn  so far anyway  I am looking forward to the snow this winter  
 In May of 1995  I purchased a 1990 Ford Escort LX  2 door  hatchback from a family friend  It was my very first car and really inexpensive  It had a 5 speed transmission  It didn t come loaded with any neat o things  but it was my very own car in high school  Over the years  I ve had to replace a timing belt  starter  battery  tires  thermostat  and engine mount It didn t come with an AC either  but had a great heating system  Although  the gas mileage was great and it was okay for the long trips back home when I went off to college  All in all  it was a descent car I say  quot was quot  because I recently wrecked it  It has yet to be determined if it the car is totaled  However  I don t think that I ll find a car that has been as reliable as it has been  To add to it  the automatic safety belt also saved my life br br  
 While on a vacation day  my husband  two kids and I decided to stop by a Ford Dealership and  quot browse quot  We hadn t really intended to buy a vehicle  but the salesperson let us test drive a 1999 White Ford Taurus and we were hooked  I have heard that the Ford Taurus is the working class luxury car  I believe that statement to be very accurate  I feel like a queen while driving my Taurus  The seats are so very comfortable  that I didn t even get stiff legs or a sore back when taking an all day trip recently  Most luxury s are standard on the Taurus that you would have to pay extra for on a cheaper passenger vehicle  We have 2 boys and this car is just right for us  The trunk is very spacious  big enough to hold enough gear for all of us for a weekend camping  We went from a Mini Van to the Taurus  and we haven t found that we miss any of the extra room that we had with the Van  because the Taurus more than makes up for it in comfort and luxury br br  
 Drove one of these for several weeks in an extended assignment in the U K  earlier this year  and was pleasantly surprised  I don t generally like small cars  but in Europe this is actually considered a  full size  model  and with good reason  It is a lot more roomy on the inside than one would think   and on the British Motorways  where the de facto speed limit is somewhere in the 85 mph range  it more than held its own against the European and Japanese pseudo luxury cars  Out of its league against the Jags and Porsches and Mercedes  granted  but it also doesn t carry the price tags those models do  I had the Ghia model  which unfortunately isn t imported here in the U S A  yet  but the American  wagon  model is the same size  If I was in the market for a utilitarian family vehicle  this would be one of my first choices  Even the styling  which I ve heard puts some people off  is a refreshing change from the ubiquitous look alike Japanese cars  
 I looked at a 96 mustang back in 1997 when I was car shopping  The mustang attracted me because the 1994 body redesign was simply beautiful  I loved how Ford captured that origional mustang style by killing off the just plain retarded looking  quot fox quot  chasis design that lived way too long  The kind I test drove was a black  quot LX quot  model that was in mint condition  The LX package I sampled was made to immitate the look of a GT with the rear spoiler  color key mouldings  etc  The car drove immaculately  but power was dissapionting  The 3 8 V6 combined with an automatic transmission barely moves this  quot sports quot  car  However  the feel of the engine and drivetrain was very quality  The engine runs sooper smooth in all driving conditions and the shifts are hardly perceptable  The interior of the car is nicely done in cheap plastic that doesn t look all that cheap  I specifially liked the symetrical dashboard and the retro looking  quot hump quot  on the dash that houses the clock  All gauges are large and clear as are the climate control and radio buttons and switches  The front seats are comfortable  but lack enough side boulster height  The rear seats are a joke  The roof line of the car is way too low for anyone over 5 6 quot  to sit comfotable w o banging their head on the liner back there  Leg room is also scarce in the back  The exterior is what I hatted about this car  As much as Ford tried to make it look like a GT  the differences that they left between the models litterally SCREAM the works NOT A GT  The tiny 14 inch alloy wheels are a joke  They look very unproportional on the car and don t even come close to filling up the wheel wells  Also  the black plastic inserts that cap the fog light location the front bumper look very cheap  Why Ford refuses to make wheels at least 15 inchers and add fog lights is puzzing  The cars would look much better with these TWO accessories and I don t imagine cost to be affected significantly  I d say mass factory production would make these two options affordable and probably below  300 in addition to the price of the car  All of that aside  I feel the V6 should be dropped completely  Mustang should be all about performance  Offering only a GT and SVT made Corba will make buyers feel like they own a real sports car  Oh  and if Ford is affrid it will loose performance enthusiasts if the special version is a  30K  Corbra  well they have the Corbra R  Also  they should itroduct vingtage packages like a  quot Bullit quot  version GT which resembles the one Steve McQueen drove in his flick  If the V6 is dropped  the GT should be an all option based car that a person starts to build up from a V8  wish it was the 5 0 instead of the 4 6  but oh well  six speed gearbox  and heater  This base car woudl probably cost under  16K  Customers should be free to add options individually instead of buying packages  I was really dissaponited with the way they screwed up the 1999 model  They ruined a pretty car  Hopefully the next redesign will be better  I recommend the mustang  but not the V6     
 Alright  This is my 2nd SAAB  i also have a 1996 SAAB 900s  without the turbo which can be sluggish  but my new 2002 9 3 is off the hook like a cordless phone Features of the SAAB  Great looks  looks like nothing else on the road  Great trunk space  more than a CR V or RAV 4 and tons more than other sedans  Good acceleration  Great gas mileage  ABS brakes that could stop on a nickel Amenities  The car comes standard with many things that would be extra on others such as  heated seats  keyless entry  front AND rear fog lights  awesome computer controls on the dash  ON star  300 bucks a month though and many other features Cons  The car is a great upgrade from the 900 series in the 90 s  because TURBO is standard now and the thing moves People say Saab s are in the shop alot  but its just how you treat them  and the new ones are made a lot better No cupholders  or at least ones you could use without hitting the guardrail Overall  Saabs are different looking  fast cars with great features  and are now more reliable than ever  One problem is that the resale value on these things suck  but hey lease one and you get a great deal  The things will last forever  and if you treat it right  it will treat you like royalty in singapore  I would definatly recommend it for the value  and overall the looks  
 The MDX was developed by Honda for those who don t know  They spent plenty of time developing the  perfect all terrain vehicle  7 years to be exact  Anyway  it s release in 2000 astonished everyone including myself  At first  I was pretty skeptical because of the weird look and small front hood region  But boy was I wrong  I went to a Acura dealer to test drive it and it was fantastic  Nice responsiveness  excellent handling  and great braking  It s styling is a little conservative when is Acura going to get over this phase  but not too radical that it looks so strange and weird that it looks like some kind of robot  It s aerodynamics are moderate with a little wind noise at highway speeds but is moderately quiet  The third row seating arrangement is clever and is similar to the one used in the Honda Odyssey  The third row seat only holds two people but what is great is that it folds neatly into the floor without compromising cargo space similar to the seats in the odyssey  The four wheel drive system on the MDX is above average on all SUVS in it s class and gives the MDX above average performance off road  I took mine off into the woods near the Pochanos into a huge river and it was amazing  The four wheel drive system automatically transferred power to the wheel with the most grip similar to the 4WD system that Subaru uses  The MDX also received the Motor Trend Sport Utility of the Year award for those technical guys out there  The interior is extremely spacious with the rear third row seat down and high quality leather trim makes you feel like your in a luxury Bentley rather than a SUV  The MDX is available in the regular trim w navigation or without  and in a touring edition with or without navigation  If you don t know what a GPS navigation system is  visit the Acura site and they have a detailed page explaining all the details  I would only recommend the navigation system to those with tech savvy know how and those who can t leave home without a map  Climate Control in the MDX is extremely efficient because it has what Acura calls the  Synchronized Climate Control System  which means that the rear seat heaters and the front seat heaters yes the rear passengers get a c  can be operated either independently or simultaneously for faster heating or cooling of the cabin  The exterior  I warn  can fool a lot of people  It s wider than you might think  On my way out of a parking lot  there was a lamppost right next to the driveway road and I hit my side mirror  So  just a warning  Overall  the MDX is a excellent value  leaving all the other  tall wagons  behind  
 The 1988 Plymouth Colt DL was imported by Plymouth from Mitsubishi  It is actually a Mitsubishi Mirage  and in 1988  it shared many of the same parts as the Huyndai Excel I bought this car from my girlfriend s friend for  600 00  It had 98 000 original miles and seemed to run good  I knew it had some minor problems which I was prepared to fix  but two days after I bought it  the rear main seal blew  The mechanic I ended up bringing it to was like most mechanics  an ignorant moron thief slut  Of coarse he found as many things wrong with it as he could break  and he broke a bunch SO  WHY DID I BUY THIS CAR  YOU ASK  HERE ARE ITS BAD POINTS  Let s see  it uses about 1 qt  of oil a week  but I have no idea where it s leaking burning from as there is no smoke or driveway stains  At lower speeds  acceleration is poor  It s not very good on gas  25MPG Highway  Under the hood  it is hard to get to some of the normal maintenance parts  especially the oil filter  It has a 2 barrel carb and parts are not readily available for it  The automatic transmission shifts at incorrect shift points  which drives me friggen crazy  Something in the driver s side front brake rattles  who would design a brake system where that could ever happen  The catalytic converter broke a week after I bought it  and I also had to spend  800  on the rear main seal  an oil pump  and a front axle  The handling charicteristics do not give the driver a feel for what s going on with the engine or road surface  it inspires no confidence in the driver what so ever  It s not good in the snow or rain  even with new General A4 tires  One headlight lost its shiney reflective material due to a water leak  There is no headlights ON beeper  so you can easily kill your battery if you forget to shut off your lights  The seats are not very comfortable for long trips  The exterior s paint is just plain ugly  Both front door locks require you to hold the outer handle to lock them  dumb  Both rear doors almost fell off  The door s hinge bolts are held in with a nut which was barely factory welded on on the inside of the door  These nuts simply broke off  thus  allowing the doors to almost fall off    I wondered why the doors closed funny  I fixed the hinges with some larger nuts and washers so the doors couldn t fall off   sounds like a law suit there  huh  When changing the station on the radio  my shirt sleeve has caught the odd shaped shift lever a few times and accidently put the car in neutral while I was driving  YIKES  The cones in the rear stock speakers deteriorated and blew apart at normal volumes  Parts for this car are not as easy to get as some other cars from the mid 80 s HERE ARE SOME GOOD POINTS  The horn works good  The car is not worth ripping off  so I don t have to lock it ever  The brakes and hand brake work well  It has electronically adjustable dual rearview mirrors  It has a luggage rack  The intermittent wipers work well   but like most  they don t give you the option of a 30 second delay for light misty conditions  It cruises well and is fairly tight at 70MPH  It has a rear window defroster that works okay but has no auto shut off  so you must remember to shut it off  It has a decent heater  but the fan must run all the time to warm your body consistantly  The 5 MPH bumpers actually work and show no damage when hit at its rated speed  The spark plugs  distributor  and coil are right in front and can be easily worked on  and you will work on them  The shift lever is in the center consul instead of the column  I like that  The dash  although square ish like all 80 s cars  is laid out fairly well  The gas gauge reads the amount of gas you actually have in the tank  as opposed to staying on full until you have 1 4 tank left  then dropping fast  The front seats recline and will accommodate leg room for taller people  and the head rests are height adjustable  For an 88  it has very little rust and is factory undercoated This car was only  600  If it was a Corolla  Sentra  Civic  it would have probably been  1500 1800  but parts would be more available  If you re a do it yourselfer  you know Mitsubishis  and you don t have much money  then this car might be right for you   but I seriously doubt it Hope this helps Dean F UPDATE on 9 27 01  Well  believe it or not  several months after writing the epinion above  I still own this car  And guess what  With much prior turmoil  I spent another  300  rebuilding the cylinder head and installing a new catalytic converter  I did most of the work myself  Here s why I DIDN T junk it  I now totally understand the ins   out of this car and sincerely believe it to be worthy of this fairly low cost repair  especially with gas prices the way they are  It turns out that the oil consumption was due to a cracked valve stem seal and a warped and improperly seated jet valve seal   luckily  it wasn t broken rings  scored cylinder walls  or a cracked head like all the mechanics said  Mechanics  UGH  I believe these seals cracked because of a factory defect and ignorance on the part of the previous owner  or her mechanic  to identify the problem  The defect was that the secondary breather hose vent  which goes from the valve cover to a nipple on the air filter housing  could not function because the nipple was NEVER drilled out at the factory  Oops  This secondary breather hose simply allows some of the low pressure crankcase vapors to re enter the combustion chamber via the TOP of the carb along with the oxygen gas mixture  This is unlike the PCV  which on this engine  sends pressurized crankcase vapor directly into the intake manifold at a higher volume  Well  once the PCV clogs due to neglect  and the pressure cannot escape due to this clog and the undrilled nipple for the secondary vent  the crankcase pressure eventually builds up  This blows the rear main seal out  Now  as all the nice hot motor oil poured all over the tarmac  I think the donkey chic that owned the car before me did not heed the multiple flashing warning lights and kept driving it  probably to get to her nail appointment  THIS IS WHAT CAUSED THE STEM AND JET SEALS TO BAKE  THEN CRACK AND WARP  This also allowed too much oil into the cylinders so it eventually destroyed the catalytic converter  too  Okay  I fixed the seals and the catalytic converter and the car runs great now and the engine is real quiet and smooth  and the automatic transmission shifts at better points  It s peppy and happy  and so am I  I drive it 70 mile a day and it has no problems doing this  even with 116 000 miles on the odometer  Now that everything is working correctly  I actually kinda sorta like this little underpowered car  It runs smooth and has some reasonable low end torque if you honk on the throttle a bit  My gas milage has improved dramatically  too  I still don t recommend ever buying one  however Please feel free to email me with questions  
 My 1987 Aerostar  what can I tell you about it  I love it  although maybe I shouldn t  Allow me to elaborate  lt g gt We bought this minivan 2 1 2 years ago  when I had no transportation at all  My old Volvo had died  I had two kids  and was really in need of a way to haul things from children to groceries to gardening supplies  So we went shopping  For history  Way back in 1986 I lived in San Diego for a summer  At that time a gal I worked with was expecting her second child  and her family had just bought one of these new contraptions  the minivan  I went out with her at our lunch hour to admire her new purchase  It was a 1986 Aerostar  the first year they were made  I sat down in the driver s seat  and I knew this was the ride for me  At the time I was driving a two seater Toyota  which I liked very much  so this minivan was like the space shuttle to me  Open  wide  expansive  modern  clean  streamlined  etc  I was HOOKED Here I found myself  11 years later  in the market for transportation  All things said and done  all debating aside  I told my husband that I just loved the Aerostar  and in a perfect world that s what I wanted  I didn t care for the newer minivans that had such a pointy front end  LOL   yes  I like the boxy look We live in a small area  so we drove an hour to the  big city   you know  where they have a Wal Mart and a JC Penney in the same town  and spent the day shopping  We had all the local papers with us  and one of the last places we checked was a dealer who advertised a 1987 Ford Aerostar for  2995  The salesman was very nice  and led us to the upper lot  where two of these vans were stored  I took one look at the gray and blue one  the two colors I love for decorating  and just knew this was the one for me Part of the reason we got this van for such a good deal was because  in addition to its age and its mileage  125 000 miles  it had an electrical problem  It didn t keep the engine or any major functions from working  but it interfered with the electrical switches to the steering wheel column such as cruise control and horn  as well as the cigarette lighter  not an issue to me  I was not daunted   this was the ride for me  Count the fact that my husband is 6 5 quot  and this is one of the few vehicles he fit in comfortably  All things considered  including the price  mileage and drive performance  this is the van we took home that night In the ensuing years  I am ashamed to say that we have only changed the oil in my Aerostar once  we put new tires on it once  and we put a new battery in it once  And that is the extent of the maintenance upkeep we have done to this poor vehicle  Yet it starts every morning  The list of things that have given up the ghost include the passenger s side power window motor  the rear passenger dome light  the power locks  the rear window defrost and the air conditioning  For a while I didn t even have heat and interior defrost  but my husband did replace the motor for that so that I didn t have to scrape the ice off the inside of the windows The big things that have happened to my poor van are the holes that have formed in the muffler  the transmission problem that ultimately led to total failure of overdrive  and the radiator problem that makes the van overheat when idling even long enough to go through a drive through  yet the gauge does not register overheating Yet throughout all these challenges  my Aerostar has started EVERY morning  It has taken me through the snow over the course of three winters now  only hitting one snow bank  yet sustaining no damage  It s done us well  although we missed the air conditioning  through two summers  The engine troubles we ve had haven t stopped our daily soirees into the big world  and the accessory failures we ve had have not been enough to kill my enthusiasm for this rig There s part of me that thinks I shouldn t be as tolerant of its failures as I am  yet part of me can t help but admire the perseverence of a machine that keeps going against such overwhelming odds  Although so much is tired  including the interior  she runs smoothly and comfortably every day  even for the new baby I may be a bit prejudiced from my early introduction to the Aerostar  but for the money  and for the lack of care we ve provided through an additional 30 000 miles  it s nothing short of miraculous that this van is still going  Yet go it does  Much to my sadness  it probably goes to the junkyard within the next few days  I tried to take it in for a tune up  and was told that it wasn t worth the money  So I m shopping again Shhhhhh  Don t tell the skeptics  including my husband  but I think I ll hold out for another Aerostar br br

 I enjoy my 4 door 2000 XLT with automatic 4WD  The 4 0 V6 SOHC engine seems to have the right mix between power and gas economy for my needs  I do not tow anything heavy  But judging by the high revs when accelerating uphill  I might be concerned about power if I were hauling a heavy load  I bought my XLT with high miles  88K  But it still rides and feels like a new vehicle to me  The ride is nice  steering is tight  brakes are responsive  It does not have independent rear suspension and you can feel it on those bumpy NH backroads It sits much higher then my 88 GMC Jimmy  This is fine for my 5 10  frame but the Running Boards  nicely lit by the lights underneath the side mirrors  are an essential options to my 5 0  wife and our children  The fully adjustable front leather seat are nice although not as comfortable as those found in the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited  I wish it had driver side memory  My wife and I are consistently having  readjustment wars  Overall  the front has a pretty roomy feel to it  All the controls are pretty accessible to the driver although I don t recommend playing too much the the many features of the AM FM CD Tape stereo while driving  Its a bit of a reach  I wish Ford had provided driver radio controls on the steering wheel The overhead console has limited display stuff  External temperature and that s about it  Would be nice if it calculted and displyed my MPG and the like  The dome lights provide good illumination as do the lighted vanity mirrors on both passenger and driver side  The auto dimming rear view mirror works nicely The back seats have a little more cramped feel to them  However they are just fine for kids  The kids can control the radio from the back and with headphones plugged in  it does not bother to the parents up front I do not have third row seating  That leaves room for only five passengers but plenty of cargo space  The 40 60 split back row seating allows for lots of flexiblity depending on situation  The Sun Roof is great and the tinted windows provide plenty of privacy  The Front Bumper does not have a place for the license plate  I screwed my plates right into the bumper cover  creating a new set of holes  Looks kinda hookey Speaking of license plates  I added a nice license plate cover to the rear but now their is hardly any room to get my fingers under the handle to open the tail gate And speaking of the tail gate  I like the choice of being able to flip open the entire tail gate or just lift the back window  depending on situation  I don t miss the fold down style tail gate that my Jimmy had but I do miss the remote release  Maybe Remote Tail gate release is a Ford option but I don t have it Speaking of remote release  I wish my XLT had a tamper resistant Gas Cover with remote release  It doesn t  I m going to have to get a locking gas cap and deal with the hassle of an extra set of keys now And speaking of security  the radio antenna is the unscrew kind  Sure hope no one decides to unscrew it and walk off with it while I m parked in at the mall  I wish I had the auto retracting variety  It would make things alot easier at the drive thru car wash Speaking of car wash  I my drivers side windshield wiper does not hold to the glass well  I tried replacing the wipers and swapping arms around with the passenger side  still not tight throughout its radius of travel The optional reverse sensing system is a nice feature and works well  Now I hope no one rear ends me  I d hate to find out what it would cost to repair that  
 Working for the rescue squad in my city  I occasionally get the chance to drive a Ford Crown Victoria  We use them as chase cars  basically  but we call them zone cars  When an ambulance responds to a scene  a paramedic can chase the ambulance or beat the ambulance to the scene using one of these cars  Response time for paramedics is much more efficient this way  It keeps us extremely mobile  First I need to comment on the handling of these cars  There are plenty of other vehicles out there which would have worked just fine for the job we use the vehicles for  but I can see why the city chose to use these above all others  They handle like a dream  They have a very tight grip on the road  and the steering is not lose at all and has little to no play in it  unlike the majority of Ford built vehicles  The seats  in addition to this  are designed deep in an effort to keep you in place while going around curves  All of these factors take a big role when you are traveling at 90mph through rush hour traffic with lights and sirens at full blast  With that said  we are glad they have airbags as well  Next on the list  the power  I m not sure what size engines these cars are normally sold with  it could be the same size we have  or it might not  The ones we use sport a 4 6L V8  I could be wrong though  because they may just very well be sold to the general public the same way they are to us  minus the white paint  reflective stripe down the sides that say rescue  and the red and white strobe light bar on top  Considering the size engine they have in them  I have noticed that they still have excellent gas mileage  It usually ranges from 20 to 21 miles per gallon  This may not seem like much  but just think of how many times we gun the engine with these cars everyday  Also keep in mind that they are usually left running all the time at scenes  For an added bonus  in case most people don t know  strobe lights  sirens  a computer  and several radios draw a lot of power from that hard working alternator  and to make up for it the city sets the engines to run at a high idle  Even after all this abuse they can still conserve a considerable amount of gas  Now for the room in the vehicle  They have a very large amount of space  We can carry everything an ambulance has on board  with the exception of the stretcher  and still have plenty of room for a couple of passengers  Most of the equipment will fit in the trunk  if not all of it if you position it right  Along with tools  a jack  and the spare tire  The space in the front is very good as well  Located up there is a clipboard  many map books  a mounted computer  several radios  the control panel for the lights and sirens  and yes  still room for passengers  I think these cars are very comfortable   I have to drive them constantly around the city for 12 hours at a time  and by the end of the day  other than being tired of working  I still feel just as comfortable as I did when I first got into the car  A direct quote given to me from one of the people that spends much of their duty time in a zone car  The city garage maintains the cars  however we still get the chance to see what repairs have been made  if any  They go into the city garage once a month for preventative maintenance  and for the most part  all we have seen done on these cars is fluid changes  engine cleaning  and adjusting the alignment  balance  rotation  and changing tires  I can say that the tires seem to get worn more often than a lot of other cars  but once again  look how we drive these cars  and besides  a different tire brand could help that  but our city is pretty stubborn  Once in a great while something other than that will have to be repaired  but what car does that not happen on  If you can find one  let me know because I am going to own one soon  Generally speaking  as much as these cars get beat up every day  I am amazed at their ability to stay in great working condition  One owned as a private vehicle would work positive wonders on your maintenance bill  These cars are built very solid  They can absorb much force in a collision  They are designed to do just that  absorb most of the impact and protect the driver  Loaded down with brake and sudden motion activated seat belts  dual airbags  shatterless windows  and a crumbling body  they can be trusted to get you to where you need to be safely  They even have a very sturdy roof  If you re wondering where I became familiar of how well the car protects the driver  they have been rolled  wrapped around poles  had head on collisions  been T boned  rear ended  etc  etc  and drivers walked away from all of it with nothing more than seatbelt sores  airbag abrasions  and a bruised ego  statement based on info gathered from sources in this rescue squad  as well as the local police departments  I have yet to wreck one  and I hope I don t  
 INTRODUCTION Toyota in past years have been for their reliability and quality of their vehicles  I still see many older Toyotas on the road today  The all new  refreshing 2003 Toyota Corolla is no exception Three models are available  CE  S  LE   the CE is the base model which carried over as the base model from the 2001 2002  which at that time the CE replaced the VE  The S also carried over from 2001 2002  as the  sporty  model  The LE is still the top of the line model  as it has been since the 1998 debut generation  Although each model has different features and looks  I will particularly discuss my tester  the CE model EXTERIOR My tester was colored in Sandrift Metallic  it was silvery tan with more tan than silver  In comparing to our 2001  the black molding is still present  which I felt has always detracted a car s external appearance  The door handles look like the ones on the new Camry and are body colored  not black like on the 2001 CE  The front and rear were totally redesigned  The front fascia features a new grille with chrome accents at the edges  and a new headlamp design that looks like no other car I have seen  It s hard to explain the shape  but the shape looks very nice and sort of luxurious  The rear looks the closest in design to the 2001  with the round reverse lights and the red lamp housing around it  The wheel size is a standard 15  compared to 14  previously  and the CE includes full wheel covers that appear to look like they belong to a base model  Overall  I love the new exterior design  and rate it a 9 10 INTERIOR Much like the exterior  the interior underwent a complete change  A new gauge cluster features a tachometer STANDARD  speedometer  fuel  etc  with a digital odometer tripmeter  An outside temperature gauge is also standard  The gauges are all black faced with white lettering and orange needles  The S and LE are white faced with different color schemes  Dash materials are not smooth surfaced like the 2001 nor are they that soft  but nice nonetheless  Air Conditioning w Filter is STANDARD on all models and the vents are located on each side of the stereo  The A C controls are under the stereo  and the controls have a nice feel when you turn them  The stereo comes with a CD player and 4 speakers  My tester had the optional cassette deck  Although the bass and clarity were okay  it is not as good as the stock sound system in the Mitsubishi Lancer I test drove  The cupholders were moved to the console area  and are deep into the console  Although I didn t have a drink with me  they appear like they may not interfere with my right arm  as I like to rest it on the gearshift  A center console storage is now standard on all models  Our 2001 doesn t have one  just pocket storage  Two power outlets are included  one on the bottom of the dash  and one inside the console storage  The rear seat is MUCH  much improved  I now have about 1 2 1  of space between my knees and the back of the driver s seat  However  the Mitsubishi Lancer has another 1  more of legroom  and feels more comfortable  I am 6 0  tall  so space in the rear is a big deal for me  In our 2001  my feet are wedged  The trunk space is larger than the 2001  and actually includes a trunk light  I have no idea why one was not included on the 2001 CE  Overall  I rate the interior a 9 10  PERFORMANCE Performance factor is where I was disappointed in the 2003 Toyota Corolla  It carries the same 1 8L w VVT i  Variable Valve Timing w Intelligence  engine  but with an increase from 125HP to 130HP and 125 lb ft  of torque  The bad thing about it is the car has close to 100 pounds of weight added to it  so the power weight ratio is no less  meaning no power increase  As a result  I felt no difference in power from the 2001  The ride compared to the 2001 is a little smoother  but not as smooth as the Mitsubishi Lancer  The handling was also no different to me  As far as fun factor goes  I think the 2001 is more fun to drive  The fact of having no performance gain disappointed me as usually with a car redesign  there is USUALLY a performance gain  Like with the new Camry  it increased from a 2 2 I4 with 136HP to a 2 4 I4 with 157HP  Although I have never driven the new Camry  I suspect performance is better than my mom s  98 Camry she owns  One improvement  however  was the upgrade to a 4 Speed Automatic transmission  rather a 3 Speed on our 2001  This allows for better gas mileage  29 38MPG  and a quieter sound from the engine  which I did notice  Braking is decent  even w o ABS  and stops smoothly  Due to the lack of performance gain with the car  which may be fine for some people  I rate the performance a 7 10  SAFETY The 2003 Toyota Corolla sustained an excellent crash test score  in fact  one of the  best picks  by NHTSA  The bumper tests also were excellent on the 2003 Toyota Corolla  No Corolla model comes standard with ABS and Side Airbags  however  they are options  For this and the crash rating  I give safety a 10 10 PRICE The 2003 Toyota Corolla is one of the lowest priced cars in its class with comparable features  The base price is  14 855 with an automatic  manual is  800 less  My tester came with Option Package  2  AM FM CD Cassette  Power Door Locks  Floor Mats  and All Weather Guard Package  and took my price to  15 407  This is about the same as a Honda Civic DX Automatic when equipped with A C and CD player  But the Honda lacks features found in the Corolla CONCLUSION Those who are looking for a solid  reliable compact sedan should DEFINITELY look at the Toyota Corolla  Our 2001 with nearly 31K miles has given us absolutely NO trouble and we have only done oil changes to it so far  I will mention again  however  that there is no noticeable performance gain in the car from the 2001  which may disappoint some buyers  including myself  For better performance and handling  take a look at the Mitsubishi Lancer  I also wrote a review on the 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer if you would like to read it ALEX S RATING  35 40  88  
 The Saab 9 5 is not the most obvious sports car  The body is big and chunky  and it looks a big  solid  heavy car  But lurking underneath is an incredibly quick and nimble car  with a ton of luxury to boot  Saab have always been known to build very safe cars  The 9 5 is an example of this  being the car that has achieved the highest scores ever in the Euro NCAP crash tests  Added to this impressive boast  all Saabs  including the 9 5  come with about 4 air bags and ABS  along with several other safety features  While sitting inside  you get a sense of importance  The dashboard is styled in a wrap around fashion  giving the driver all the controls in one area  I only had about half an hour actually driving the car  on the Millbrook test track just north of Luton  so I didn t get a lot of time to play with the controls in detail  However  all the controls seemed solid and responded well  They were all laid out quite logically  and were all easily reachable without fumbling about  The 9 5 Aero that I drove had a host of extra features that would not be found on every model  including leather seats  steering wheel  etc  But the Saabs true merit has to lie solely in its performance  The figures speak for themselves really  It does 0 to 60mph in 6 5 seconds  and is good for almost 150mph  This is all due to the 2 3 litre turbo charged engine  All Saabs have turbo charged petrol engines  and so Saab have become very good at this  Most turbo charged cars  such as the Mondeo ST200 and Subaru Impreza  have  turbo lag  where it takes a while for the turbo to kick in  and when it does  it hits with a bang  However  with the 9 5 Aero  the turbo is instantaneous  and you wouldn t even know it was there were it not for the incredible power that it produces  The 9 5 is incredibly smooth  This is partly down to the incredibly smooth power delivered from the powerplant under the bonnet  but it is also due to a very well tuned suspension and tyre package  With such a large an heavy car  you would expect a certain about of wobbliness  with the car rolling side to side as it entered the corners  But  to my surprise  the car handled very well  almost like a small car such as an Astra or Focus  The Millbrook test track is quite severe  with lots of climbs and drops  up to 21  gradients  and tight corners  so it was an ideal place to test the agility of the car  It felt composed throughout the test  with little in the way of body role  yet the ride was smooth over the bumps  Around the high speed bowl  the acceleration was very fast  I was limited to 100mph  but the 9 5 achieved that speed very quickly  and was certainly ready for more  The gear box responds positively  with a very short distance between gears  There is also a very nice lock on the gear stick as standard  The ignition key barrel is actually located alongside  just to the bottom right  actually  of the gear stick  and to remove it  the gear stick must be in reverse  which locks it in gear  thus rendering the car useless  unless it can be unlocked  This works quite well  The advantage of having the ignition key located in the centre rather than on the steering column is two fold  though in Saabs  official  view  just the one  Firstly  it is a lot safer  as in an accident  the ignition barrel is a very hard  non moving piece of metal that will hit your chest  so moving it to the centre console is a lot safer  Secondly  it means that if you have a lot of keys  they won t keep banging against your leg as you drive  The car is full of driver aids  The seats are fully adjustable  as is the steering column  There is electric everything  and full climate control  rather than the standard air conditioning  Also  the car is split into zones  thus enabling you to change the temperature in different areas  though dramatic differences are obviously not possible  The noise produced from the AC is dependent on how high you turn up the fan  but you can leave it on the Low setting and it still reduces the temperature nicely  When I tested it  last Tuesday  26th June  the outside temperature was around 30 degrees centigrade  yet the temperature inside dropped quite quickly to a much more comfortable 18 degrees  This is truly a great car  and has to be recommended 100  to anyone who can afford it  The power is just sensational  the handling solid and smooth  and the luxury unparalleled in its class  Plus  everything comes as standard  so you don t have to fork out more money to get the specs you want  unlike with BMW   Mercedes  
 I bought my Ford Focus ZX3 for many reasons  It has air conditioning  cd player comes standard  it s roomy enough for five people  and there is enough room in the hatchback that I feel I am driving a mini van  In fact  it resembles a mini mini van from the outside as well  The interior has many comfort features for a car this price  including adjustable seat height to accommodate the taller or shorter driver  The dash has a very modern  sweeping look  Driving the car is comfortable as well  It has great handling  good speed  and convenient placement of controls  It is available with anti lock brakes and side airbags as options  but driver and passenger front impact airbags are standard  It is also available with remote entry  which is a lifesaver when your hands are full  I believe this car would be great for just about anyone  Younger drivers will love the sporty look  while families can really appreciate the roominess inside  Parallel parking is no longer an issue  because although is is cavernous inside  it is still compact outside  I realize that in most reviews  the cons should be addressed as well  but in my opinion  there are no cons  This is a great car at a great price  It is not a  quot luxury car quot  Heated leather seats are not an option  It is not a  quot status quot  car either  It is a comfortable  fun and affordable mode of transportation  Check it out  it may be your next car br br  
 I have  96 Tahoe which is a lease but we are planning to purchase when that runs out  in July  And I just absolutely love this vehicle  It s been extremely reliable  knock on wood  and we have not had any major problems with the vehicle at all  Yes  we ve put in some money  put I honestly don t think it s been more than  800  excluding oil changes  and some of that is your 60 000 mile check ups where the tires are rotated  etc  Not bad for a truck that has almost 80 000 miles on it now  We originally leased the vehicle because we had a yellow lab puppy that was growing up and out of my tiny sports car and we planned to travel with her alot  I know  a big investment for a dog  LOL  But we also knew that the time wasn t too far off when we would start a family also  So far  it s worked out great for long trips with the dog and our daughter  Fits all the things you need to travel w kids for long weekends  etc   you know  the portacribs  the toys  etc and the dog still has room to ride comfortably I love the way this vehicle rides  also  To me  it s right up there with some luxury cars  The ride for the most part is smooth and does not have a  truck feel  to it at all  I think the only complaint I have about it is that the back windows  on the  barn door  style  do not open at all  I remember with the old Suburbans  you could pop the back window so the bottom would be open a bit  of course having the dog back there made me think of this feature  It would also be nice to have some climate controls in the back seat  The front passengers sometimes need to freeze boil in order for the backseat passengers to get comfortable  Oh  and also the placement of the cup holders  they are right in front of the vents  so if it s winter and you have the heat on  there goes you cold cola or in the summer  no more hot coffee  Some of the features I love are the compartment for your sunglasses and the car garage remote  even though I don t have one  Also the 2 extra lighter plugs so I don t have to take out your lighter in order to use a cell phone or radar detector Over all I just love my Tahoe and you d have a hard time convincing me to give it up except for a brand new one maybe br br  
 I purchased my  99 Ford Explorer in May of  99  As to this date I ve not regretted this purchase  I received great service from my Ford dealer  There have been several recalls but now of them of any great importance  I have 2 teenage children and they both have plenty of room  The model I purchased was an Eddie Bauer and it has all available options with the exception of the moon roof and the CD changer  My explorer was put to it s first test about a month after it s purchase when we had to make an emergency trip to Dallas  we re stationed at Camp Lejeune  NC  This vehicle performed great on the highway and especially through the mountain regions of I 40  A draw back for me oh this vehicle was I went from driving a Mitsubishi Diamante to driving this SUV  this Ford is obviously larger and it felt like it might roll the first couple of times when forced into urgent breaking situations  Just give yourself time to adjust if going from a car to a larger vehicle as such  As far as trips to the dealer for repairs  it s been to the dealer 4 times for repair of the rear wiper unit  the dealer admitted to Ford having this problem with this line of vehicles  Basically it has a mind of it s own  works when it wants and hopefully I won t be going through all that again  Excellent audio system with a standard Mach system  An all of this is at a mere insurance symbol 8  Ford offered on the lot financing that beat all the banks and credit unions     
 I recently rented a midsize car in Reno and I got a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee instead  Quite a deal  huh  See this review to see how this happened http scottcolson epinions com content 25929617028 Anyway  what did I think of this SUV b Exterior  It has average styling for an SUV  They are typically big vehicles and this goes along with the trend  There were already a few chips in the paint  so I don t know if it is poor paint  or the fact that it s a rental  I wouldn t have expected much body damage with only 8000 miles on it b Interior  The inside was very spacious  I think you could seat 5 without difficulty  The fabric was nice on the seats  not leather  but in the heat I wouldn t have wanted leather anyway  The inside looked more classy than the exterior did b Interior features  The coolest feature had to be the digital thermometer  outside temperature  and digital compass  I ve never driven a car with this before  In addition it had cruise  AM FM cassette  I m sure CD is available  A C  power windows and locks  This car had most of the comforts you would expect   Power  Now  I m no car expert  Dammit Jim  I m a doctor  not a mechanic  but I think this vehicle is underpowered  It has a V6 engine and for this size SUV  I didn t feel we had enough power  Now I m used to a manual and I was driving an automatic  but I still think that they could give this a little more  I cannot imagine trying to tow using this beast b Handling  It s got a nice smooth ride to it  but I wouldn t want to parallel park this thing  I drive an SUV normally  1998 Isuzu Rodeo  so I m used to big  but this didn t handle well at all   Gas mileage  I didn t calculate it  but I d guess it to be about 17 mpg  Now  I know it s an SUV  but even my Rodeo gets about 22 23 mpg i Editorial note  Wow  It is taking me a long time to write this  I have a patient in labor right now i b Interior space  I don t know the exact specs  and I didn t do a lot of hauling with this SUV  but it seems as though it could hold a lot b Overall  I think this was an OK SUV to rent  especially since I didn t pay to rent the SUV  only the midsize price  but I don t think I would ever consider buying this  I ve not been impressed with Jeep in the past  and I think it is overpriced for the power you get Thanks for reading my review  
 This is my personal favorite truck on the market  and this is coming from a guy who knows trucks  It is a nice large truck without being as awkward as the F350  It fits into a standard sized garage but is far from standard  It has higher torque than the competition so that you can be towing anything from a sheet of plywood for a Sunday house repair to a load to a construction site and not be able to tell the difference  Also I think it looks nicer than the dodge or chevy models  making it nice for just a flashy ride around town  It comes at a true value when considering the versatility this mammoth piece of truck has  If you are looking for a truck for any reason at all whether it s for a ride around town or a vehicle to pull a work load in style this is the truck for you   
 A few years ago my sister bought a new Nissan Altima XE after she received her Master s of Veterinary Science from Mississippi State University  She needed a new vehicle to replace her aging and fairly unreliable 1987 Chrysler LeBaron that took her through undergraduate school and beyond  She was about to embark on a two year internship at several farms and animal hospitals throughout the US and Canada  She looked at several vehicles in the compact midsize range and ultimately purchased a Nissan Altima XE for around  14 500  Her car is finished black enamel with a dark gray cloth and black interior  The XE is the base model Nissan  It comes with a 2 4 litre SEFI transversely mounted inline four rated at 150hp and 167 lb ft torque at 4000 RPMs  It s mated to an optional   for XE  4 speed automatic transaxle with overdrive  A five speed manual is the standard transmission  Mechanically  the car has been extremely reliable  My sister reported no major mechanical problems after almost 63 000 miles   fairly high compared to what I put on my vehicles  I ve driven her car and it seems to have plenty of power  except perhaps on very steep inclines such as the mountain road outside my upstate Pennsylvania hometown  Even then  I didn t have to mash the throttle to the floor as I have on some 4 cylinder vehicles  The steering felt precise with little or no torque steer effect  The car braked in fairly short distances  The Nissan XE comes with a lot of features for a base car   power windows  power mirrors  tilt wheel  but the seats are manually adjusted  There seems to be plenty of room up front  though the back seat seemed a little cramped when I sat back there when I rode with my Dad sitting in the front passenger seat  The base radio is AM FM cassette  but my sister replaced it with an aftermarket unit with a ten disc CD changer mounted in the trunk  The dashboard controls are well laid out and the instruments are easy to read  Unfortunately it also has the stupid tach in place of a much more useful ammeter and oil pressure gauge  Why do automakers put tachometers in cars equipped with automatic transmissions anyway  Also  like too many other cars flat blacks and grays dominate the instrument panel and the rest of the interior  I can t wait for the day that we return to the more colorful interiors of the 50s and 60s  A little more fake wood and chrome accents would help  The chrome Nissan  hamburger  logo on the steering wheel breaks up the monotony a little  The HVAC system worked well  but I felt it was a little slow to cool the car  though this could be due to the car s black interior  The interior materials were a little disappointing  I was expecting a Nissan to use material superior to that of domestics  but I found it the same as in my Dad s 1997 Mercury Mystique  The black steering wheel was exhibiting a slight milky white haze  Also  like too many base vehicles  my sister s Altima had the tacky flat gray plastic wheel covers  though the chrome Nissan logo made them look a little upscale of other makes  plastic wheel covers  If a car has to have wheelcovers in place of real alloy wheels  make them out of stainless steel and use a more imaginative design instead of the fake sport wheel look  Nobody s fooled  The GLE s alloy wheels are sharp and do wonders for the car s appearance  The trunk has a low liftover and provides plenty of space for her veterinary equipment and luggage despite the space eaten by the CD changer  It looks shallow but it s deep  Best of all  Sis  Nissan has  get this  A FULL SIZE SPARE  Hallelujah The worst aspect of this Nissan is its paint  My sister cleans and maintains her car fairly well  but the clear coat is flaking off in dime sized chunks on the slat grille and has a slightly oxidized look overall which I find bad for a four year old car  Has anybody else experienced this with their Nissan Another problem she had was that windshield cracked badly for some unknown reason  It was replaced and paid for under her insurance All and all my sister is very happy with her car  If somebody wants a modest car in the compact midsize range  the Nissan Altima would make a good choice  
 A few weekends ago  we went up north to the small town I grew up in  We had decided to rent a car for the weekend  and seeing as how we re not rolling in huge mountains of money  yet  we reserved a compact car to make the journey  When we got to the car rental place  they had run out of cars but had lots of minivans and SUVs  We opted for an Explorer When we got to the garage we took a double take at the back of the Explorer  There was a pickup truck style payload back there  Sure  not as large as a regular pickup  because the Explorer has full sized back seats  but it could still hold alot The Sport Trac is definitely geared toward the youth market  It has all the  people room  of a fancy SUV  with  cargo room  at the back that you wouldn t mind loading with a ton of dirt or something  because it s outside the vehicle  rather than inside a luxurious one The payload area is extendable  however  with a nifty little cage apparatus that swings out and locks when the tailgate is down We gave the Sport Trac a good run while we had it  running up 500 km  300 miles  in about a day and a half  even taking it over some really rough roads to try out the 4X4 capabilities  No problems in that department The engine is big and powerful  probably capable of handling mid sized towing loads like fair sized boats without any noticable difficulty One of our favourite features was the electronic rear window  Punch a button and the window cracks open a couple of inches  Twist it one way and the middle 80  of the rear window disappears behind the rear seats  Our passengers in the back seat absolutely loved riding with the window open  especially off the highway  where engine noise was minimal Overall  a great combination pickup SUV  I d rent another in a second  Lots of fun to drive  and although it does look a little strange at first  the appearance grows on you  
 The  99 Acura Integra is one of the best cars that I have ever had the chance to experience  If you re a person who has had an older Acura  you need to get the updated  99 Acura with all of the new specs and performance  The difference in the  99 and the older ones is really spectacular  and amazing  Although there are too many features to list right now I can provide you with some of the more updated things that you might need to know Here are the things about the performance that you should know Powertrain Transverse front engine front wheel drive with equal length halfshafts Alternator 90 amp max Battery 12V  maintenance free Engine Block Aluminum alloy with cast iron cylinders Cylinder Head Aluminum alloy Emission Control 3 way catalytic converter 100 000 Mile Tune up No scheduled tune ups for 100 000 miles  Interval Engine Type LS  GS 1 8 liter  4 cylinder  16 valve  DOHC GS R 1 8 liter  4 cylinder  16 valve  DOHC with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control  VTEC  system Horsepower SAE NET LS  GS 140 hp 6300 rpm GS R 170 hp 7600 rpm Torque  SAE NET LS  GS 124 lb ft 17 1 kg m   5200 rpm GS R 128 lb ft 17 7 kg m   6200 rpm Redline LS  GS 6800 rpm GS R 8000 rpm Bore  amp  Stroke LS  GS 3 19 in x 3 50 in  81 mm x 89 mm  GS R 3 19 in x 3 43 in  81 mm x 87 2 mm  Displacement LS  GS 112 cu in  1834 cc  GS R 110 cu in  1797 cc  Compression Ratio LS  GS 9 2 1 GS R 10 0 1 Induction System LS  GS Programmed Fuel Injection  PGM FI  GS R Programmed Fuel Injection  PGM FI  with dual stage intake manifold Ignition System LS  GS Electronic Ignition GS R Electronic Ignition with knock sensor Valvetrain LS  GS 4 valves per cylinder  belt driven  dual overhead camshafts GS R 4 valves per cylinder  belt driven  dual overhead camshafts with VTEC  The comfort of this car is amazing  The top of the line GS R leather makes your ride not only enjoyable  but soothing at the same time The grace of the drive train would be the same as racing down a straight away as if you were the only one on the road The mileage is okay for a sports car  but it is worth the gas money for this ride The maintenence of the  99 Acura Integra is nothing major  only a few minor oil changes when neccessary  at least every three months  recommended  which is not a major hassle Well there is really nothing more to say about this great car  I recommend this car for people who really like a good deal  I also recommend this car for people who have  quot  the need for speed quot br br  
 I think I jumped into the SUV Craze just before it started  Isuzu Rodeo  Its ruggedness and nice look sold me  so instead of buying the Maxima  I bought slightly more expensive Isuzu  There are two company that are very alike in this automobile industry I think  Those two will be Subaru and Isuzu  Why  They are making very good cars  but with very minimalistic approach  They never equip a car with luxury  but essentials  Goods 1  Engine V6  If you are looking for a car 1995 SUV market  then Isuzu is a great choice  It has very lively V6  It s not as sophisticated as a competitive let s say Toyota 4Runner V6  but it responds at your will even a bit jerky at sometimes  So  power is never an issue with Isuzu Rodeo unless you are thinking about 4 Cylinder which I know nothing about  If you need even more or passing power  there is a power button that add some kicks  2  Versatility I am sure every car in this SUV market probably falls into this category  But when it comes to money to Space ratio  Rodeo is a great choice  For the money around  19000  it provide more or equal usable space than any other SUVs  I went to ski with this car and carried full load of people  I went everywhere with it  When I had to go to furniture shopping  I didn t have to worry about renting a truck  I can fit almost everything inside  3  Roominess This Rodel has really high ceiling  If you are 7 footer  I think you can sit comfortably  I never owned Jeep Grand Cherokee  but I hated its small interior space and small cargo space  In the back seat  you have plenty of leg rooms even if you push the front chair all the way back  4  Spare tire I think this car was one of the earliest SUV offered external spare tire storage  It s very convenient to have a spare right in the back of the car  The main I liked this is its look  It just add more rugged image to the whole car  I have seen this car without the spare in the back  It looked awful  It looked like it was missing something  5  High Ride   Comfortable Chair People love SUV because of its commending view  This car is no exception  The Dash board in this car doesn t take much space and they are placed pretty well belowed the eye level  so the view is really crear  Even the hood is flat  Chair is not plush but it s well padded  I drove this car from Maryland to Vermont without any back pain Bad 1  Ride You can think of this car as a truck  That s more precise  The shock is good quality  but the car is a bit on a heavy side  not overwhelming  Ride is I think more like average  Since all SUV has high center gravity  you cannot drive the car like regular sedan  However  I knew that this problem changed  Ride was greatly improved in later models  My friend bought same Isuzu in 1997  and it had more car like ride and cabin noise was reduced quite a bit  2  Too simple sometimes This car is never luxury  It changed now  but at least then  it wasn t  For the money  you could have bought a sedan with a lot more features  so you sometimes miss the luxury amenities or simple things like cup holders  3  4 X 4 This car doesn t have on demand 4x4  I think later model has added this  but 95 model didn t have it  You have to stop the car to engage the 4 X 4  It worked beautifully  but I didn t like the fact that I had to stop  4  safety No Air Bag  No ABS  I had this car about 5 years  Every 2 weeks  I cleaned it and waxed it  It s a very very nice car  It drives well  carries tons of stuffs  and no major breakdowns unless you cause it  I really want to recommend this car  but at the same  I am a bit hesitant  In the rain or in snow  this car is terrible  Most SUV manufacturer shows SUV going through jungles or snow mountain  but when driving on a wet road or snowing road  this car is not that good  Back wheels are the problem  You can oversteer so easily  If this car had ABS or Traction control  then it would have solved a lot of problems  but it doesn t  So  you have to drive carefully in bad weather like any other cars  So  what do I think about the car  Half and half  It s good and bad at the same time     
 Our family of five purchased the Ford Expedition in 1998  My kids like to call it the  quot Big Blue Bus quot  They are right  it is Blue and yes  it is very big  We are certain when our lease is up that we will be buying another Expedition or Navigator same as the Expedition just more bells and whistles  We owned a jeep Cherokee previous to this car and as a mother of three I feel that my kids have much more room and are safer in our Expedition  This car is by far my favorite  There are only a few negatives I can come up with  First of all it is a little difficult to get the third seat into the vehicle  We keep ours in at all times now  but before our third child was born we would switch it in and out   this was not easy due to the cumbersome seat it was impossible to do alone Once the third seat is installed your back hatch storage area is limited  but I just put things in the back seat  I would prefer to have a fold up and down seat in the back  Also  the kids have to climb over the second seat to get into the back seat  I think the car would be more functional if the two middle seats were bucket  this feature is on the Navigator Those are the only negatives about the car  Otherwise  it is a very sturdy  smooth running vehicle that I would definitely recommend to anyone with a large family br br  
 I recently just purchased a 2001 Kia Rio Manual Transmission  I m a single father and college student so I needed something that was dependable  My 1987 Honda Accord was requiring frequent visits to the garage  Anyway I debated about buying a used Honda  but I wanted a new car  After all my Honda has kept up for 14years  I drove it to New York last year and it took a trip to Maine in 1988  So the durability has been proved  I do hope that the Kia will last just as long I debated about getting a 1995 Honda that runs at about the same price as the KIA I purchased but that came with miles and no warranty hmmm the Kia sounded like a good investment  ecspecially with the warranty  I was able to get the basic edition for 7485 00 no radio  A C but thats for an entire new car  I live in Cincinnati so an A C isn t a necessity  although I will be cursing myself come August  but they did give me the option of having one installed for 1000 00 if I so desire  I test drove the KIA and really liked the body style and it really seemed to be made very durable  I was surprised considering the price  It seems to handle very well in all driving conditions  except going uphill  But it handled fine over bumps and winding roads  It kept up fine on the highway with traffic  This is a basic car and for the money it can t be beat  There are alot of reviews out there  some negative  some positive  For now this car is great  I had to take a gamble on this vehicle as I m sure many of the 1st honda owners did as well  I just hope this car makes it as long as my 1987 Honda has  I think its really hard to say a car isn t worth the money until we are able to get some relability ratings in place  This is the first year for the Rio  For people on a limited income its a great car  ecspecially with the warranty  And for all the negative reviews that are out there lets hope all us Kia owners can  stick our tongues out at them  in ten years when this car is still on the road  Update I ve had this car for almost 2 years now and  no  problems  I ve kept up on regular maintenance  etc  I ve driven to New Jersey on several occasions  It s started during cold winters  hot summers You won t turn heads in this car  But who cares  I d rather have money in the bank  If you ve got money for a new Toyota  buy a Rio and take a vacation or buy a motorcycle  
 After being devoted Toyota owners for 5 years  we decided to make the move to a minivan when our second son was born  We decided on a 1995 Nissan Quest  fresh off the showroom floor  as it felt closest to our Toyota Camry  I adored the quiet ride and tight handling at first  but quickly began to regret my decision  Within the first month of driving my Quest  we began experiencing seatbelt problems  The middle belts would lock up after use  making them inoperable  A service check revealed a potential computer problem and the seatbelts were  quot fixed quot  However  we continued to have intermittent problems  My quiet ride soon turned into a noisy adventure  and several belt adjustments didn t fully correct the  quot clicking quot  of the engine  The cassette player decided that it didn t like to broadcast sound through the left speaker when it was cold  and the sliding door didn t like to remain latched  After a few adjustments to the door latch  we became used to driving with the interior lights turned out  as the shock of having them blind us on a journey down a dark highway when the door decided to pop open became too much to handle  We experienced problems with the rear wire harnesses  a problem we learned  quot sparked quot  a recall  What a service nightmare The Quest is a bit smaller than many of the other minivans on the market  but for those looking for a car like feeling  this can be an asset  Gas mileage was good  but frequent trips to the service department were a hassle and expense  While the 2000 Quest is a roomier model with more luxury  I still suggest looking at the Honda Odyssey or Toyota Sienna instead br br  
 I bought this vehicle first because it is a Ford  and second because I love the way it looks  It s not too big  but it s not too small  I like the rounded edges of it  It also gets better gas mileage than the larger SUVs The storage space is huge when you lay down the back seats  They are easy to lay down and give you lots of room to put luggage to travel or to move furniture  I travel frequently with my dog and have a large carrier  It fits easily in the back and still there is plenty of room for luggage The back seat is not extremely comfortable for long distances  However  you can easily transport 4 to 5 people short distances  The back seat is not easy to access  for large adults  however  I recommend this SUV for singles anyway  not for families I like the height of this vehicle  You have good road clearance and you are sitting up higher than a car  but not too high  It handles well and there is minimal road noise  I would definitely purchase another     
 This is a good car to have and I have like it ever since I bought it  So far I have had no problems with it  I would recommend this car to anyone  I also have two 10 in subs in my car that put out some good bass but it could use some work  If you are looking for a car to have good bass then I would consider another car because the back seats block a lot of the bass  Other than that I like it     
 My husband and I have owned a 1990 Ford Probe for 5 years and haven t had any serious problems with it  So  when we were looking to get another used car  we both wanted another Probe  In our search  I stumbled upon a loaded 1996 Probe GT that was listed on EBay  The car was located at a dealer in Miami which is over 1000 miles away from our Connecticut home  but the price was worth it for the high end model  We won the auction at a little under  6000 which was a lot cheaper than we would have paid locally  The car was shipped to us about a week later First off  this is the most beautiful car that me and my husband have ever owned  It is red with a tan leather interior  The car is loaded with options such as power windows  power locks  cruise control  remote locks  CD audio with subwoofer  sunroof and chrome rims  Also  the GT model comes with the 2 5L V6 engine which is much stronger than the standard 4 cylinder engine  We constantly have people telling us what a nice car this is  If they only knew the price we paid The car itself handles very well and feels brand new even though it is a five year old car  The gears shift effortlessly and the acceleration is very quick  There is also very little noise and the drive is smooth  We haven t driven this car in the snow yet  but our 1990 Probe does well as long as the snow isn t deep  We like the fact that the Probe is front wheel drive in case we get caught in an expected snow storm We have two small kids  age 4 and 5  and there is plenty of room for them in the back of the car  The driver and passenger seats are also very comfortable for adults  but longer legged individuals will certainly cut into the back seat leg space  The controls are well laid out and our AM FM CD stereo came with a subwoofer located in the trunk  From what I can tell  this is a factory stereo and the sound is very good  We also have a power sunroof that slides up and back to let in sun and air  It doesn t have the clear cover that some power sunroofs have to let in sun and not air  The hatchback trunk is very roomy and the back seats fold down to accommodate longer objects The Probe was discontinued by Ford in 1997  but there are a lot of used ones on the market  If you are looking for a sporty car and don t want to spend a lot of money  this is a good automobile to check out  Our 1990 Probe has been very reliable  but it is too early to tell how this 1996 GT model will be  So far  we have had no trouble driving the car over the past two months since we purchased it  My husband and I have been having a lot of fun driving this car and hope to get a lot of miles out of it  We purchased the car with 73 000 miles and the car is still like new  
 I was told by my boss lately that it was coming a time to trade in my 1996 Chrysler LHS  and get another company car  I immediately went to my local Chrysler dealer  I requested a LHS and a 300M  When I drove the 2000 LHS  I knew this was the one for me  The things that impressed me the most was the handling  auto door opener  heated seats  and the price First  the handling  Right when I drove off the lot  I could tell this car has tight steering  which is good if the car ahead of you put on the brakes  and you had to swerve to miss him  it turns on a dime  It also had a nice ride  better than the 300M  In the 300M  you could  feel  the ground as you were driving over it  In the LHS  it was more of a coast over the highway  instead of feeling every bump along the way Next  there s the auto door opener  I never thought this was possible  When you buy the car  you get 2 door openers  One for husband  one for wife  or whoever  But  depending on who opens the door with the door opener  it will set it to the radio stations or  if that person was listening to a CD last time  it will find the one CD out of the four CD disk changer that person likes  AND it will set the seat  Raise  lower  forward  back  or tilt  That blew me away Next  there s heated seats  What an ingenious idea  My wife is always cold  and I always ride with the windows rolled down  So  she can set her side of the car to be 80 degrees  while my side can stay 71 degrees  It does this with the heated seats  Setting it to two different degrees also changes the air temperature and how hard it blows on either side Lastly  there s the price  For  26 000  you couldn t ask for more  Besides the handling  auto door opener  and heated seats  it also has a very spacious trunk with a big  mouth  on it for easy access and a great looking car  I am going back to get it later this week  and I know I like it  and think everyone will  
 In 1996 my family purchased a 1993 Pontiac Grand Am SE at a used car dealership just outside of Dillsburg  It had about 74 000 miles on it and when I first sat down in the comfortable interior I could tell immediately that it was well built and definitely superior to the Ford Tempo my dad had just taken for a test drive  Now we re nearing the end of the century  and the Grand Am has never let us down  It did have a faulty battery that needed replacing  but it has never overheated or broken down  Since we have to travel at least a half hour to go to the nearest shopping mall  we ve racked up many miles on the Grand Am  A little over 131 000 miles  to be exact  The interior is still in remarkably good condition  with very little wear  with the backseats having plenty of leg room  and the engine  a powerful V 6  is still in excellent condition  The car itself still has the pickup it was made with  and continues to be a reliable and comfortable drive br br  
 I bought this truck new in 1994 when the local dealer was having a big sale  I purchased a pretty basic S model  with only cloth seats and no exterior chrome trim  but I did get the V6 and a limited slip diff  The Isuzu is certainly reliable  I never had a single major problem during the time I owned it   about eight years and 50k miles The list of small problems is short  a leaky radiator hose  and noisy valve lifters when the engine was cold  The engine did develop a persistent oil leak after a dealer recall to service a plug in the rear of the cylinder head  It was pretty minor  so I never took it back to be repaired  but I wasn t impressed with the service department s work You should be aware that the Rodeo has pretty poor gas mileage  at best I was getting perhaps 18mpg  and the engine tended to use a quart of oil between changes  although this was pretty constant over the 50k miles I drove the vehicle One negative to consider is the manual 4wd that the 1994 was equipped with  In order to shift into 4wd  you must be stopped  and to shift out  you have to stop  shift out of 4wd  and then back up 3 feet or so  This isn t a big deal if you are in snow for long periods  but where I live  snow is usually only encountered over ridges  followed by long descents on plowed roads  Of course  you can just leave it in 4wd  but that takes a toll on the tires and the drivetrain  as the parts all scrub against one another  due to slight differences in the speeds at which the individual wheels turn  So  I wouldn t recommend this car as a ski vehicle to someone who lives in California or Washington I eventually sold the vehicle because ultimately it was not enough of a truck to function as a truck  and a little too unrefined to be a car  as well as a gas hog  For my purposes  I prefer to have two vehicles that are each dedicated to the function that they perform best  However  if the wallet is a little tight  the Isuzu won t disappoint you Be warned that the vehicle is not as sure footed in slippery conditions as you might expect a four wheel drive vehicle to be  The rear end is much lighter than the front and it s easy to snap it around  I ve been sideways twice  once on black ice at 50mph  and once in slush at 30  and although both occasions had happy endings  I would hesitate to recommend this car to an inexperienced driver Any tappet noise should be investigated when purchasing the car  Definitely listen to a running cold engine  I have heard other complaints about this  and it appeared to worsen over time  In fact  I sold the car to a friend who then left his wife and ran away to Thailand  a long story  leaving the car parked at my house for a year  When he returned  the tappets were so loud  we both thought major surgery was in order  However  he added a bottle of Rislone to the engine  and the noise cleared right up  This was surprising to me  because I always assumed that engine additives were complete snake oil  but it really did the trick in this case To sum up  check the tappets  be aware of the gas mileage and handling issues in the slippery stuff  and if none of that dissuades you  then buy this truck  
 I moved from a two seat sport car to the TrailBlazer and after surviving the initial culture shock and gasoline bills shock I don t regret the move  The TrailBlazer handles well at all speeds  It s comfortable  and driving 600 miles without a relief driver didn t leave me exhausted the one time I did it  I would not have ordered four wheel drive  but that s what was on the vehicle  In February when the roads were almost constantly snow covered I was glad to have the four wheel capability  After 10 months of service there s still no hint of squeaks or rattles quite a contrast to previous GM vehicles  The LTZ model is packed with convenience features and gadgets  and the Bose sound system is great  
 SHOP AROUND BEFORE YOU BUY Get the Saturday morning papers early and shop the loss leaders from the dealers  Be prepared to get the run around but if you stick to your guns you can get a great deal I bought a New 2001 Loaded Eddie Bauer with Entertainment rear parking control towing everything List  40 800 I PAID  29 900 SHOP SHOP SHOP This is the third Expedition we have owned a 1997 1998 and now a 2001 Eddie Bauer A few things influenced our purchase  1 Ford now included a lot of the luxury items from the Navigator  The auto climate control  the power pedal assembly  Rear distance warning and memory seats to name a few 2 Ford came out with the rear entertainment system for  1300 and then make it free as a promotion 3 Ford brought out a  2000 rebate Overall I like this truck and having put over 60 000 miles on our last two am fairly confident in its overall reliability  They still haven t addressed its few bad characteristics The luggage area with the 3rd seat in place is not large enough Access to the 3rd seat is hard and requires you to climb over the middle seat The standard 17  tires and suspension package aren t up to the task No rear speakers for the 3rd seat passengers which means making the sound too loud for everyone else so they can hear 
 My high interest in vintage Mustang s took a strange turn in 1994  Until then  I had despised the turn the car had taken in the 80 s  This changed when I started drooling over one of the first Mustangs of that year in Car amp Driver  The new body was simply gorgeous and aggressive at the same time  and still remains as one of my most favorite sports car designs  Ford had taken a futuristic look and combined it with some of the best qualities of the 60 s body style  The side skirts and the galloping horses were there again  and the car supported a higher back and a lower front end  The line that started on top of the back trunk followed the sleek body all around until reaching the front grill  The wraparound headlights were an excellent change from the common up down flipping lights that the Firebird had  The new body was modern and classic looking at the same time  and had an aggressive quality to it that I found attractive The interior had also changed completely  Gone was the square and boring implementation from the 80 s  The car now resembled a cockpit  with the instrument cluster following an ergonomic and circular shape  The dash board was also the same  and the horn was easily accessible on the steering wheel  Perhaps the only complaint that I have about this car is the ford s never changing radio buttons  The back seats were nothing to speak of  but you should stop reading about sports cars if you care about them Despite these changes  the old carburated 5 0 engine came almost identical from yesteryear  The car still lacked the HP and the acceleration offered by the GM s f bodies  It could beat anything other then the Firebird and the Camaro in its price range  but my marriage to Mustang would be postponed until 1998 because of performance issues  When I decided not to put up with the downsides of Firebird Formula  the only other car that caught my attention was the Mustang Cobra with around 300HP   Don t get me wrong  I still loved the GM muscle car  but it just didn t correspond with my day to day driving needs  At that point in its history  the Mustang engine had gone through a complete check up   it now sported a 4 6 liter engine  known as modular  that was more up to date with modern technology  The body was relatively the same as the 94 model  When the insurance on the Cobra became a big problem  I ended up with a 24 valve GT  The acceleration on the 97GT  although not as good as f bodies  can beat anything in its price range  The engine punches 215HP in its stock form  the 98 model was 225 HP    with a torque of around 300lbs  My car came with optional ABS  leather seats and Ford s 460watt sound system  I can t stress enough how many times I considered myself lucky to have the ABS  The stock rims on the GT were 17x8  with 245 45 dunlop tires  These hugged the road quite well  but I switched to 17x9 Cobra R s and 255 45s all around for better handling  The car had a decent height from the ground  and was a whole lot easier to get in and out of unlike the Firebird  I dropped the height by about 1 5 inches using Eibach Pro Springs  and its still quite good Perhaps the area where the 94 98 body shines to most is the visibility factor  The back is a lot more clearer than you would expect in a sports car  and the higher front seats offer a better view of the road ahead  Believe me  this seriously helps in heavy traffic and when you are merging into a tunnel  The front seats are very comfortable  providing a smoother ride than one would expect in a sports car less than Corvette  I drove the vehicle from NY to Vermont  only stopping for gas in the way  None of the pains and the aches I would experience in my old car were present I have driven this car for about 60k miles  and so far I have no complaints about reliability  But then again  most sports cars require more attention than the rest as they are driven hard  I am a quick driver  I don t do anything stupid  but I drive fast   So what if sometimes I drag race like an idiot  but that only happens once in a while  I had to get the clutch plate changed at 40k miles  but that was my own stupidity  I did a full throttle take off forgetting I had left the gear on two   the end result of which was black smoke and burnt plastic smell coming from the engine  If you don t do anything as dumb as this  even with hard driving the Mustang remains reliable until 60 000 miles  I will update this review if I run into any other problems in the future   At  61k miles   the car started to rev itself at idle and the air conditioner stopped working  I am somewhat mechanically inclined  so I figured the AC was out of gas  but the automatic revving didn t make sense  Doing a visual check of the AC showed me that the compressor had stopped working  and assuming the best I started checking up the wiring on the AC before going to a shop that would charge me 400  It seems that a switch is dead  and no electricity is conducted to the compressor  I think the CPU is making the car rev trying to boost start the compressor  I took out the faulty switch and calcelled the AC on the car  and I will update this when I find out the price of the exact part  Shouldn t be over 30 i i Ok  the piece was 18 bucks  It took me a bit to order it  but its coming this week  Let them mumble and babble about the reliability on the mustang  mine has almost hit 65k and its still ticking like a clock  And I drive it hard every single day  Phewww i i Attention  Some 97GT s suffer from a faulty intake manifold  Although my car didn t have this problem  you must read about this if you own a 96 or a 97GT  Please go to http mustang epinions com auto review 3BF2 1856ED5 392EC638 prod2 i br br  
 Well I bought my Protege in Feb of 99  and base model that is  A 1999 Mazda Protege DX  I have owned new cars my whole life  I have dodge Neons  Dakota  Ram  Tempo  and Ford Probe  I have had new cars my whole life  and when I purchased my Protege  I was very excited about that  I had an accident a month after I bought my Protege  I brought it to the dealership  and they were just so helpful and willing to do anything to get me back into my car  after the 3 000 bill  my car ran even better  I am very pleased with my car  in fact i m getting ready to do something I have never done before  i m going to trade my car in for the newest model the 2000 Mazda protege  One last thing I think you ll like  is all protege s  regardless of model  comes equipped with a CD player  your teenager will love that  It is a safe vehicle as well  lots of cab space  drives very smooth  all and all it is a very nice car br br  
 The 1991 Chrysler LeBaron  in my opinion  is one of the better cars on the road today  Taking in the consideration of it s gas usage alone  any other car in it s class does not come close  Origionally built as an affordable alternative to larger  more expensive  upper crust  vehicles  the LeBaron should not be passed by as just another  econo  car The interior  built to withstand high usage  was excellently done by the company  Rugged  yet elegant  carpeting  plush seat material and durable accessories are just the start of what you will find inside  Depending on what grade of model you are considering  rest assured  only quality parts were used in their construction The exterior of the vehicle does experience the otherside of the  good bad  spectrum  The paint used by Chrysler Mopar in the early 1990 s was under par in conparison to similar models of other automakers  The paint will typically begin to  peel  and  flake  in portions of the car that are not normally prone to wear and tear  These areas may include the roof  trunk lid and hood  To help prevent against this  regular washing and waxing is personally recommended  Just as a side note tip  if you are experiencing this on a small scale  and you car is of a common color used by other automakers  try using touch up paint or even nail polish to cover these blemishes  Make sure to check to see if any rust has formed first before application  Underneath the car also has some issues  The transmission being the main problem  Chrysler Mopar  in my own personal belief  designed the transmission in hast  not taking in account of drivers actually  using  the cars to their full extent  If you do experience difficulties in shifting  such as  sticky gears  or hesitation from one gear to anther  like myself and many others did  be sure to have a professional take a look at this problem before it supernovas into an expensive replacement  If replacement is the only option  expect to pay from 1 000 00 to 1 850 00 for a quality rebuilt or reconditioned transmission  Any type of extra weight  weather it exists within the car or toeing a trailer  watch out  Make sure to check the transmission fluid before during and after such an event  It would not be a bad idea to have the transmission drained and filter replaced every 10k miles if you are using the car to haul or pull heavy items All in all  for long trips or short runs the 91  LeBaron is an excellent choice for any driver who wants to experience a quality automobile at a reasonable cost  
 As the late Fall leaves of the Central Valley trees continued to fall off  covering most country roads  I opted to test drive the Santa on freeway 99 as far south as I could  After all  Hyundai brought to the elite group of SUVs an addition that is a head turner  As I was driving by some small cities along the Freeway  I could help thinking that this Vehicle is equipped with some of the latest features in the automotive designing and manufacturing  Hyundai wants to take all the precautions to come up with a hit  The company has been saying bye bye to the  quot dud years quot  that brought marginal profits on its vehicles b Driving with peace of mind  New Option of side air bag helps protect your brain  i Tests done by the insurance institute for high Safety reveal that head protection devices protect against fatal head injuries  Since 1997  major US automotive manufacturers have figured out that it s high time to protect their customers  brain by cushioning their head in case of collisions that could result in head injuries  They have decided to add this option even though they know they are not going to be rewarded by NHTSA  In fact  what they did was just to join the majority of European car manufacturers who had installed the side air bag for head protection  What has come to be referred to as  head bag  can be found in most state of the art European imports such as Volvo  SAAB  Porsche  Boxster etc  In fact  they are standard  While Hyundai put this equipment as standard on Sonata and XG300  it offers it as an option on Santa Fe b What do you need to know in the 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe b i My advice to you is to get the option of side air bag for your new Santa Fe   Who knows that it may not come handy while driving on off roads and the jungles of South America and the desert of Death Valley  for example  If you are going to pay this much money for a new vehicle  why can t you request a safety device that can protect your brain for about  300 00 or so  At least  this is my remark  It makes sense b What s the hoopla on 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe b   Get the lowdown on it now  Well  let s try to dig the Santa Fe by looking at some of its features  First things first  it comes in 6 models  Base  GLS  LX in either 2WD or 4WD  I test drove the Santa Fe 4WD 4 Dr Sport Utility   Standard Features   Cruise Control  Keyless remote entry system  Power locks  First aid kit  Power heated mirrors  Leather bucket seats  Auto day night lamps  4 wheel discs brakes on all models This 2 4 6 cylinder engine with a a 4 speed Shiftronic automatic transmission will get the job done for you  If you intend to run your errands around town  you will be able to do that  It can be a good commuter vehicle  I had a lot of fun test driving it  In fact  I am surprised by how sleek the Santa Fe is  It has a bundle of technology in it If you are looking for an affordable vehicle  then you can find one here br br  
 I am not a big truck fan  never have been  It could be because trucks were merely work vehicles when I was growing up  and even as I approached driving age  When I was a kid  trucks were always stripped down and offered little in the way of comfort  It s hard to say when this changed exactly  but it did change  Many modern trucks are more comfortable and luxurious than their car counterparts  GMC s Yukon trucks and Ford s Lincoln Navigator are perfect examples Now we are entering a new era of truck and truck usefulness  For a few years now  auto makers have been attempting to sell us on the  crossover  vehicle  A crossover vehicle is simply a combination of two  previously unrelated  type of cars  The Audi All Road is a crossover vehicle   part SUV  and part station wagon  The old GMC Syclone and the current Ford F 150 Lightning are crossover vehicles of sorts  part sports car  and part truck  The latest fad in the crossover world  SUV s with pickup truck beds  The Lincoln Blackwood  Chevrolet Avalanche  and Ford Explorer Sport Trac are all examples of vehicles that started life as a simple SUV  then mutated into some kind of SUV truck crew cab pickup thing  The result is generally quite unpleasant  The 3 previously mentioned vehicles are nothing short of pure ugly  and most of these vehicles leave the owner with diminished people capacity  and limited cargo capacity  But remember  I m not a truck guy  so maybe I m biased The Ford Explorer Sport Trac is a valiant attempt at trying to combine the best of two worlds   small SUV and pickup  In the crew cab segment  there are plenty of good choices  Models such as the Toyota Tacoma  Nissan Frontier  Chevy S 10 and Dodge Dakota all offer crew cab configurations  The Sport Trac is different  it started life as an SUV  the Explorer  and ended up having a truck bed grafted to the rear  All the other crew cabs began life as exactly what they are  pickup trucks  A true  equal to the other brands would be a Ford Ranger crew cab  however Ford has wisely chose the Explorer platform from which to build a new SUV  The Explorer has been one of the best selling SUVs of all time   Ford knows not to mess with success  While the all new Explorer is a vast improvement over the old  the Explorer Sport Trac will make due with last years platform  On the road  the Explorer Sport Trac s aging heritage is obvious  The ride is a bit bouncy  and uneven pavement is a very unpleasant experience  Handling is fair  and only gets worse when pressed hard  Speed bumps seem to be this trucks nemesis  Approach speed bumps at crawl  anything faster will result in lots of bouncing  There is some interior noise as well as engine noise  but it s not intrusive  The cabin is much quieter than a Ranger  but not as quiet as the S 10 or Tacoma crew cabs  The Sport Trac lacks the smoothness of the Toyota  Acceleration is more than adequate  and the Sport Trac has the competition beat hands down with more horsepower than any other V6 crew cab truck  The Sport Trac s 205 hp is obvious when passing at highway speeds  or simply merging onto the highway from a stop  The S 10 and Tacoma both have 190 hp  the Dakota 175 hp  and the Frontier  non supercharged  offers 170  The Dakota is available with a V8  something the others lack  Although the Sport Trac is at the high end of the price range for mid size crew cab trucks  the extra power alone may be worth the money Inside the Sport Trac is a rugged looking yet somewhat luxurious interior  Leather seats are a worthwhile option as they seem softer and more comfortable than their cloth counterparts  The leather group option includes a power driver seat  overhead console with compass and temperature display  front center console and separate rear audio and climate controls  That s quite a bargain for about  900  still I couldn t help but want a power passenger seat as well  Remember  this is a  27 000 truck when equipped with leather  a CD changer and a sunroof  Even though it is part of an option package and not included in the base price  rear audio and climate controls are not even available on the Nissan  Chevy  Dodge  or Toyota  again the advantage of basing the Sport Trac on the Explorer rather than a pickup truck  The rear seat room is far greater than any of the other offerings  A minor complaint is the lack of steering wheel mounted audio controls  The cruise control functions should be move to the side like on many Toyotas  leaving room for audio and ventilation controls on the steering wheel  This is only an issue because the radio seems like such a reach from the driver s seat  Most other controls are logical and easy to understand  yet lack the wonderful ergonomics of most Toyota products  The Sport Trac has an excellent center console  with lots of space  two cup holders and an open storage area for sunglasses  wallet etc Here is the bottom line  the Explorer Sport Trac is not a great vehicle  the ride alone is enough to turn many buyers off  The other mid size crew cab trucks are also better looking  That being said  the Sport Trac excels in a few VERY important areas  1  The Sport Trac offers real world utility in a fairly luxurious package  2  The Sport Trac offers ample rear seat room   4 or 5 adults can ride comfortably  that s not true of the other crew cab trucks  3  The Sport Trac has the most powerful engine in this class without sacrificing fuel economy  19mpg highway isn t bad for a truck  It only seems like 3 strong points  but I would argue those 3 points account for 90  of what shoppers are looking for in an SUV or crew cab pickup  Looks are subjective  and trucks ride like trucks  Take away those two factors and the Explorer Sport Trac is the best vehicle in its class by far  
 I work for a Hyundai dealership and I can tell you that it is one of the safest cars on the road  They have two airbags  front and rear crumple zones  steel beams down both sides of the car and on the roof  They also have break away motor mounts  which means you get into a head on accident the motor and transmition fall to the ground and not on your lap  The only other car that has that feature is the Volkswagon  Hyundai also has the best warrenty on the market  with 10 years 100 000 miles on your power train  5 years 60 000 miles bumper to bumper  5 years unlimited roadside assitanist  The Elantra is equipped with standard features like power windows  power locks  power mirrors  air conditioning  am fm cassette radio and four doors  It is a great value for a family car  I give this car my seal of approval  expecally as a mother br br  
 I have had my Galant for 2 1 2 years now  I bought it new after looking at all the current reviews and not finding anything too controversial  The main thing that hooked me initially was the appearance  the fact that the rear windows go all the way down  and the financing   0 down  etc for a year b Engine   Transmission  The transmission and engine are very good for a 4 banger  The transmission is electronically controlled to match your driving style and environment  Some of the previous reviews commented on the lack of power especially uphill  This is very likely if the previous drivers had  light feet  I have a very heavy foot and have no problems climbing consistent steep hills   The AC can cause problems since it steals so much from the engines power  This can be reset by disconnecting the battery but I wouldn t recommend it unless you have the CD player s security code  The tranny for the most part is bulletproof  It is stable with a 75 shot of NOS or 8 10 PSI from a supercharger   Sound  The stock sound system  not premium  is definitely lacking  The front 6 1 2  speakers and the rear 6X9s are only 15 watts each and the deck barely peaks that  Replacing these was one of my first projects  Having absolutely no experience working on cars  I was still able to replace the deck and all four speakers with relatively few problems b Support  I was lucky to find the best online Galant website   http www clubtgc com   This is a forum with 2800 members that either drive Galants  are mechanics or are Shops looking to help customize  Here you can find great information for your every desire from adding a supercharger or turbo to your engine to just getting new brakes at great prices They also have a great section for car problems or questions that are regularly watched by Mitsubishi mechanics   Customization  By purchasing a Galant you are already saying that you want to be different   Otherwise you would get a Camry or Accord which thus far have better track records Add a spoiler  a drop  some altezza lights  new rims and this 4 door family sedan is now a sleek looking ride  I have had many people complement me on how hot my car looks  How often does that happen with an Accord or Camry   Reliability  I am now at 46000 miles  The battery went dead last month  I replaced the brakes pads at 30k  I did get the 72000 7yr extended warranty but haven t used it yet  I have generally had good service from the Mitsu shops   Both times were problems caused by my messing around with different things  One time I accidentally grounded a wire while installing the back speakers  the other was the back bumper paint was webbing from closing the trunk too hard  Both times they took care of the problems and were very accommodating   BTW the trunk is very light and takes almost no effort to close at all  this makes it really easy to slam especially if you are used to older cars where it takes a good yank to close The glovebox is plastic and very poorly made  After about a year it began to rattle constantly  The lock comes out sometimes when you lock it and Mitsubishi hasn t come out with a solution for this problem   Tires  I didn t care much for the stock tires and rims and replaced them with 17s and good tires  The stock tires do not handle turns much over the speed limit and are become quite noisy after a few minutes over 85mph b Seating  The front seats have plenty of head room and leg room  I am 6 3  and fit well  However I have the seat all the way back so the people in the back aren t as lucky  As others have mentioned  the back seat situation is horrid  Having grown up in a Camry family  I noticed that the Camry is no better  I am usually alone so this isn t much of a problem The seats themselves come with a nice stain resistant fabric that looks and feels decent  However after 4 5 of driving  they become quite uncomfortable  I recently got leather installed for  600 and that solved this problem  
 I am known to be extremely picky and analyze things to death  When buying a car it was no different  i new I wanted an SUV type of vehicle and after many months  quot exploring quot  the possibilities I chose the Ford Explorer Upon comparing other SUVs I found the Explorer to have a much more comfortable ride due not only to the suspension but the seats  The options available on the Explorer are reasonable and well worth the price I believe this vehicle is a good choice for the person or family on the move  It has excellent  quot trunk quot  space which can be enlarged by folding down the back seats and the passenger leg room is more than ample  The only down side I have found to the Explorer is gas mileage  however this is common in all SUVs  As long as the potential buyer keeps in mind they are not buying a compact car the mileage estimate will not frighten them off  After owning my Explorer for a few years my parents purchased one for themselves  They liked mine and thought it would be a good car for them based on my experiences with it  I was pleased to see that the quality had improved since I first purchased mine I have now had my Explorer for 7 years almost 97 000 miles and I am not ready to give it up yet  It still has many  many good years in it  When the time does come to purchase a new vehicle I hope Ford will still be making the Explorer  I would buy it again br br  
 My Chevy Cavalier is the smartest purchase I think I ve ever made  I bought it brand new in 1992 for  10 400  I wanted a car that was inexpensive  low on maintenance  on good on gas  I got all that and much more  After 93 000 miles  I am just now replacing the original tires and rear brakes  Other than that  all I ve needed to put into the car were front brakes  oil changes  and tune ups  I ve never owned a car that has required this little maintenance after so many miles  I have saved quite a bit of money over the years by choosing this car The Cavalier is sporty looking  has a smooth ride  and is fun and economical to drive  Although I love my car  my next vehicle will be a pickup truck I need something with more hauling capability  Even though my next vehicle is several years away  I plan to stay with a GM Chevy  model  Until then  I will enjoy my cavalier for many years to come  It will last longer than I ever thought it would  Even today s Cavalier models appear to still be a great value for the money     
 I own a  97 SL1 with keyless entry and the 5 year extended warranty  Aside from the fact that the car is the right size and is economical for my family of three husband  self and 2 5 year old son  It s the ease of ownership  I m the sterotypical female who just wants to get in the car and drive  I couldn t tell you when to change the oil or when my tires need rotating and if something is wrong with my car i just want it fixed a fixed fast  Saturn doesn t make me think about my car  when my oil change is due I get a post card  i take it in pay  21 they change the oil and check the other fluids run it through the car wash all while my son and I sit in the kids waiting room I bought this car in July of 96 Since then my repairs have been  quot a dead battery quot  in 98 which was covered under the warranty and replaced for free  And just this month I had a  quot bad brake booster quot  I brought the car in at 3 p m  they said they couldn t get to it  till the next day and since I had the extended warranty handed me and my son the keys to a 99 SL2 rental  They even moved my car seat from my car to the rental  along with making sure they moved some of my sons toys The saturn is a great car  i love the way it handles and the weight of it  other cars in it s price range seem lighter on the road and I like a car that doesn t feel  quot plastic quot  It s no frills yet stylish  mine is gold  and it fits in any parking space  It s great for using a middle back seat car seat and the keyless entry is great when unlocking or popping the trunk while carrying a baby  or a squirmy toddler But  it s the  quot no worry quot  service from the dealership that has us set to buy another saturn when we buy our next car br br  
 I was used to driving vans and was ready for a change  I wanted a SUV and wasn t sure which way to go  So the search began  Since I didn t have to have something right away I took the luxury of shopping around  I was sure I wanted 4WD and started test driving  pricing  negotiating  etc  A salesman talked me into driving an AWD V8  What a pleasant surprise Immediately I knew this is what I wanted and I have had no regrets since I even had the misfortune of having the  quot recalled tires quot  but Ford   Firestone quickly took care of that for me The ride is wonderful and all the power features are great  My favorite is the  quot combination door locks quot  If you want to leave the car running while you run short errands  warming up in the driveway  paying for gas  etc  you have no worries and you know you will never be  quot locked out quot The AWD is terrific  It s amazing how it senses the terrain or conditions  but like magic it does and you never have to worry about getting stuck  I am convinced that I will stay with the Ford Explorer AWD V8 as long as they keep making them br br  
 This is my fifth Ranger  Although it is a 1996  it still looks as new as a 2000 model  Absolutely dependable  quite comfortable and roomy even for someone as large as myself at 240 lbs and 6 6 quot  My previous Ranger  a 1995 was probably the best vehicle I have ever owned and I ve owned 46 cars and trucks in my lifetime  This one I found at a local new car truck dealer and when I drove it couldn t tell it from a new one  After nearly three months and 4 000 miles  it hasn t disappointed  It starts  stops  handles  looks great  Although it doesn t have the comfort of a Lexus  what pickup does  it is quite comfortable even for long trips  have taken several  Fuel mileage is quite respectable at about 18 overall When comparing the Ranger to its competition  it should be obvious to anyone with a discerning eye that there is no competition  The Ranger is the gold standard for comparing any other like vehicle  So long as I buy pickups I will need only stop at the local Ford dealer to find what I want and need  Absolutely recommended without hesitation     
 I LOVE this car  I bought it last year from my father with 175 000 miles on it  It s only had two owners besides me  my father and another guy who recognized it as I was getting gas  He said  quot How many miles now quot  I told him and he said   quot She still runs beautifully doesn t she quot  I told him all we did was replace the timing belt and besides that no other repairs  He just nodded his head  My particular model is a 1989 Prelude S in Gold  No power windows or doors  but then again  they can t break  It has a power sunroof though  It is in excellent condition  except someone hit it in a parking lot and broke one of the parking lights and beat up the bumper s paint  Besides that  the only problem is leaking oil  i think i cracked the oil pan gasket  It is at 191 000 miles now and is still the most fun to drive car i ve driven  The steering on these cars is exquisite  with just the right amount of power to make it easy  I can t stand mushy steering  The S model is a little on the weak side but with the manual transmission  it can hold it s own  Also  the transmission is a pleasure to to shift  it s very slick and has never failed me  The front seats are very roomy  while the back  Well  i don t ride in the back  but i get to laugh at my friends contorting themselves to fit  Also  my air conditioner doesn t work  but i always drive with the windows and sunroof open  so i really don t care  it would just make it less fuel efficient anyway  By the way  I m a drummer  and I can fit my whole 6 piece drumset plus it s rack in the car with the backseat down  So whoever says it s too small  imagine that I also installed a Pioneer CD player and upgraded Sony 3 way 5 1 4 quot  speakers  It sounds beautiful  although it was kind of hard to fit the speakers  as they are supposed to be 5 quot  openings     
 Well  Here s your lemon story  I bought a 1995 Mustang  V6  new from the dealer  I loved the car  the body style  the interior   everything  At 2000 miles a fuel injector was replaced  At 4000 Ford was replacing my engine  Not to mention the horror story of the dealership wars  After that it was constant   I had an electrical short in the tape deck that no one could ever find  my oil pressure guage didn t work and was replaced  the emergency brake was replaced and the window mechanism was replaced 3 times and I still had problems  Needless to say  the car was eventually bought back and I received a 1998 Mustang V6  I ve had this Mustang for almost 2 years and no problems yet  Definately love the car  Now the only drawback is the snow and ice   mustangs are sleds in the winter br br  
 We bought this used van because our Plymouth Grand Voyager had finally gone kerplunk  and we needed something quick Priced at under  10K  with immaculate interior  this full size van was hard to pass up I have to admit  I was a little intimidated at first by it s size  I wasn t too keen on driving a full size van  I was afraid I d hit something by backing into it After getting used to the wobbly steering  this van won me over heart and soul  I feel safer in this larger vehicle  and the semi drivers no longer intimidate me  It s nice to be able to see over the guard rails as I m passing by them  Gee I never knew there was a lake over there The one problem I do have  is that I have many blind spots  There are curtains all over the vehicle  but even with them all open I still have some sight problems We have plenty of room in this van  We are a family of 6  with a 2 1 2 year old  so room is a necessity  We even have room for one more child  We bought this van in excellent condition  with 69 000 miles on it for  9 999  It runs like a dream  starts every morning  and the interior was well taken care of  The family person who owned this van prior to us took very good care of it Unfortunately  with the price of gas these days  it takes over  50 to fill up my tank  I only get about 11 miles to the gallon  But I can live with the cost of filling up the tank as long as she does me good  If you re in the market for a used van  I suggest you check into this one  If you can find one that was as well maintained as ours  you ve got yourself a van br br  
 I have a 96 F 350 4x4 with 351 eng  and C6 Trans  In 17000 miles I have lost both exhaust manifolds due to leakage  The transmission went out a spark plug rusted into the head and broke off the calipars have stuck causing poor braking the paint white vehicle developes small rust spots on it and mileage is 10 mph at best The service writer at ford told me that ford has had a problem for years with exhaust manifolds especially on 351 eng her own mid 90s ford developed the same rust problems When I bought the truck I told salesman I was going to use it as a tow vehicle  I tow a 3500lb trailer and this eng trans combination with 4 10 gears has all it can handle  Ford must be doing better with the newer super duties  On yah I was told by the dealer that ford has now fixed the premature problems with exhaust manifolds they do not use that eng  anymore  Good fix     
 I purchased a brand new bright red truck in November 1995 my husband said   not another red truck  Yes  I like red  and I like trucks I had brought home a darker blue truck  but it was automatic  power windows  and other frilly stuff that I didn t want or want to pay extra for  My truck had the following features 6 cylinder  standard transmission  5 speed  anti lock brakes  back sliding window  long bed  A C  power steering  and a bed liner What I liked about this truck  at the time I bought it  was that we could all fit into it  However  for my older kids  the fold down jump seats in the back section were uncomfortable on long trips  The last big trip was from Tennessee to Oklahoma and then back  My son at the time was 15 and my daughter was 12  They were most uncomfortable and had to take turns riding up front  And I liked the price  It cost  12 799 with all the financial stuff  This was the third vehicle that I bought at  Woody Anderson Ford  in Huntsville  AL  And If I still lived there  I probably would have traded it there and bought another Ford product I was faithful about regular maintenance  but this silly truck had a mind of its own  First it was the door open chime it just would not shut off  Back to the dealership  it was covered under the warranty  Then the wipers went off on their own back to the dealership  covered by warranty  By this time I was wondering if I had made a good decision about this truck  Then the interior light would not shut off  my husband just got a potholder from the kitchen and yanked the bulb out  He was beginning to be frustrated by constant trips to the dealer for little electrical repairs I noticed a smell around 35 000 miles or so  Something was hot under my truck  I took it in and asked them if there was anything under there that might get hot during driving  They checked the radiator  and other items like brakes etc but not the problem  After the big trip to Oklahoma  it finally broke  and it was a carrier bearing  My mechanic basically told me that this was a design flaw since the drive shaft was not so long  it didn t really need to be built like this  Just another moving part to break Once all of the electrical problems were repaired and the carrier bearing was repaired  the truck was very reliable for 120 000 miles  And a trip to South Carolina  Myrtle Beach  At that time it was traded for a much more comfortable vehicle for our growing family of 5  We bought a  Plymouth Grand Voyager   van  See my review on it please My truck was not a reliable vehicle in ice it froze to the ground and we could not budge it no matter what we tried hahahhaha only in Tennessee right  Okay  so maybe it was built on a Monday  maybe it was just that model year  But I did not buy another Ford truck and I had owned 2  so maybe I ll let Fords rest and get a Toyota or a Chevy next truck purchase  
 This past week end  I received an invitation I could not turn down  A dealer friend of mine asked me to do him a favor  He asked me to give a demo of the beauty  ruggedness  durability of the F350 Lariat Super Duty Super Cab 4WD 2 Dr  Extended Cab to one of his best customers  an agribusiness patriarch  Free opportunity to test drive this elegant vehicle  That was the first idea to come to my mind  When I asked my friend why this gentleman could not come to the dealership  He replied that this guy buys so many Fords from him for his company that it was his way to give him customized service  I thought he was right  After all  it was a question of selling one more truck and making money   Background  Ford s Tradition Lives On  Henry Ford  father of the Ford Motor Company  once said   quot I will build a motor car for the great multitude It will be so low in price that no man will be unable to own one quot  Without any doubt  Ford s F Series pickup truck has managed to continue the Ford tradition of quality and innovation  It is one of the most successful vehicle lines in automotive history   Bonus Built or Built Stronger to Last Longer  i 2000 Ford F350 Super Duty Super Cab was built to last much longer i After reviewing with the dealer what my commission would be  I drove to a nearby gas station to fill the truck up  Then  I headed towards the freeway  Powered by a 8 cylinder  5 4 liter 260 horsepower  the Ford 350 easily negotiated the entrance to the freeway under the gazes of other commuters  The exterior was a harvest gold color  I checked around me to find out that the truck has power windows  door locks  These features are standard on all XLT and Lariat models  By the way  the 2000 F350 Duty Super Cab is now available in 6 models  XL  XLT  and Lariat in 2WD and 4WD  If you are interested in this truck  you may want to require your own specifications  Just like the aforementioned customer  you call the shots  Actually  the depth of your pockets calls the shot here  Some of the new features also include front tow hooks  spare tire lock  a heavy duty battery  I am sure you will fall in love with the power trailer towing mirrors  I also want to draw your attention to the buck seats  This is a very convenient truck that will meet your individual needs b This truck is able to pull your trailer  After about a 50 minute drive  I reached a little town called Goshen right on Freeway 99 here in California  Going from Modesto to Goshen is a straight shot on the freeway  After a few detours  I reached a compound and proceeded to the office  There  I met an old man and two of his sons  By the way  he talked  I could sense that this guy is not ready to let his youngsters call the shots around the farm  I gave my presentation and showed the vehicle  Before I even finished  the patriarch said he wants to trade in two of his trucks  In other words  he wants two new Ford 350 Super Duty Super Cab   quot Great quot  I told myself quietly I reached into my pocket for my Cellular phone  I ended up leaving a message for my dealer friend on his voice mail  Selling two trucks instead of one is going to make him happy  Now  I understand why he goes out of his way to accommodate this guy  He is an important customer b My impressions of the trip and truck  I had fun driving through the Central Valley  I enjoyed driving through the farms  This truck was truly built for quality and enjoyment     
 After the birth of my son  I needed to get rid of my trusty but cramped coupe and get a sedan with room for the diaper bag  Lured by the low financing offers flooding the market  I set my sights on a 2002 Nissan Altima  That dream ended when the tester I was driving stalled in the dealership lot  it was an automatic  I turned to Mazda  which at the time was offering 0 percent on all 2001 and 2002s  Our choice came down to a base 2002 626 or the dealer s last 2001  an ES V6 with automatic transmission  leather  moonroof  Bose CD and 16 inch alloys  Naturally  I bought the 2001  When it comes to roadability  the ES V6 handles well  The automatic gearbox is fairly smooth though it sometimes sounds as if it is hesitant to shift when coming up to highway speed  Steering is very smooth and braking is adequate  my car is not equipped with ABS  which is an option  There is no mistaking the V6 under the hood  though I m sure it is be more fun paired with the available 5 speed The interior styling of the 626 is quite comfortable  The leather seats  though not heated  are very supportive  Controls are very easy to operate  but sometimes awkward for those of us with shorter arms to reach  Cruise control buttons are mounted on the steering wheel  but there is no indicator light to tell you if the system is on  As in the Toyota Camry  the cupholders are mounted just behind the gear selector and in front of the center armrest  which has a built in power plug and CD case  The rear defrost switch is somewhat obscured by the steering wheel  something Mazda is reportedly addressing  As for noise levels  don t expect Camry quietness  While not loud by any means  the 626 always lets you know it running Exterior styling is very smooth  The 16 inch alloys give the car a bit of an aggressive stance  It s not Altima like styling  but it s nice nonetheless I have had to take the car in once since I purchased it  A piece of door trim was installed incorrectly and ended up bending another piece of door trim  The dealer replaced both pieces under the warranty  
 I bought a 2000 Chevrolet S 10 4WD at this time for 1 reason  0  financing for the term of the loan offered by Chevrolet  I feel that the S 10 with the wide stance is an attractive truck that does not look like the small S 10 boxes that Chevrolet puts out  True  it s basically the same truck  it just looks better  The wide stance S 10 is I guess a ZR2 version  The frame has been modified slightly to accept bigger tires and provide the wide stance  I read the review regarding the S 10 feeling like a car ride  You don t get that with this truck  It feels like all truck  The step up into the cab is a step up  If you are not able bodied you would at least need running boards or some other method to get in and out  After getting into the truck I m happy with what s there  This is an LS version which has  air  AM FM Cassette  CD player  cruise  tilt wheel  heated power side view mirrors  power locks and windows  remote keyless entry  and speed sensitive stereo volume  The headlights activate by themselves  daytime running as well as night time full activation  The controls are easily to use  with the exception of the windshield wipers and cruise control  which are on the turn signal knob  At times they are hidden behind the steering wheel and I find that I have to look for them  Other controls are easy for me to reach and convenient The 4WD drive buttons are just to the right of the steering wheel  the lights are automatic  the stereo has a dial for volume  easier than my Alpine push buttons in my Explorer  Everything else is right where you d expect it to be  There is also a third door for access to the extended cab  The extended cab is more or less a glorified storage area  My 16 year old daughter sat back there and said it was okay but I can t imagine being there for any amount of time  I also hear that riding in these extended cabs is unsafe  as a rear end collision endangers this passenger as the truck collapses  With this passenger sitting sideways  I can imagine that an accident could cause serious problems  I have found the area useful for storing tools that I would not want to put in the bed area The seats are comfortable for all rides that I have been on with it  1 1 2 hours max  The drivers seat has an adjustable lumbar support  I would think that this is more than you can expect from a small pickup truck  This truck has a poor turning radius  The ride is sometimes rough  truck like  but the larger tires and lifted truck provide excellent vision  The extended cab portion helps expand the field of vision as well  This truck seems to be using more gas than I would expect but the V 6 engine seems to have all of the power I need  I would recommend this truck to someone who likes the looks of a truck and expects a truck ride  It s no passenger car and it is basically a two seater as well  It does serve well as a truck br br  
 We bought the Dodge Ram Quad Cab in 1998  I was nervous at first but we needed a larger vehicle with three growing boys  We had a Stratus but the back was getting tight for the kids  We test drove the Dodge Ram and I was amazed I could drive it  There is a lot more room in the back for the kids and with the bed  everything goes in there and not on everyone s lap  It was very surprising how much more you could actually see when you are driving  I would always get nervous turning onto street because I could never see if anything was coming  Now I can see down the road and have no worries  When winter hit I hung up my keys when we had the car  Where we live it is all hills and I just did not have the nerve to drive  I trust the Dodge Ram   especially with four wheel drive  I now take my kids to school snow or not  I have a lot more confidence behind the wheel     
 Actually  this vehicle is owned by a good friend of mine  However  I ve driven it as least several hundred miles myself  so I can certainly offer a valid opinion on it  My friend didn t actually intend to buy this vehicle  He was taking a look around at a few car dealerships about 3 years ago when he found it  After taking it for a spin once  that was it  he bought it  At the time it had 35 000 miles on it and he paid about  8000  It s the AWD  turbo  manual transmission model Other than it being a manual AWD turbo  what else is good about it  The build quality  The Laser is of course a re badged Mitsubishi Eclipse  only the exterior styling differs  the mechanicals are identical  Even with the 60 000 miles he now has on the Laser  it is really rattle free  dependable  and very fast  His best run with the car in the 1 4 has been a 14 9  with full interior  aftermarket stereo  including woofer box  and no modifications  It s easily possible to boost the car into the 250HP range with just a few simple bolt ons  It is SUCH a fun car to drive too  being a 2 0L 4 cylinder  when you take someone for a ride in it  unless they know its a turbo AWD  since he has removed all the emblems  peoples reactions can be quite interesting  Usually I start driving around at fairly low speed RPM  as the turbo doesn t provide any boost till somewhere around 3 000 RPM  Normally  the typical response is  quot what s so great about this car quot  at which point you floor it  Once the boost kicks in  the car is a whole different animal  particularly leaving the line on boost at about 5 000 RPM  the car pulls like a V 8  With a stupendous redline of around 8 000 RPM  cruising down the highway in 5th  dropping into 3rd and hammering it lets you whip most of those pesky Mustangs and Camaro s our there that like most V 8 owners  can t imagine a 4 cyl  being a fast car Are you an individual who is maybe looking for a inexpensive second car to trick out  Are you an individual who would like a reliable daily driver  that s also really fast  amp  reliable stock  BUY THIS CAR br br  
    The Ford Explorer first introduced in 1991    has been one of the top selling SUV s in the market  For 2002 the Ford Explorer has been rather dramatically redesigned  There is more room  it is bigger  more comfortable  and a new independent rear suspension and many more new features that will be explored through out this review b   One important new feature is the bumper height has been lowered full two inches b    It s kind of nice from a safety point of view to have bumpers that match up with the majority of other vehicles on the road b   Even though it has been lowered    it is still a difficult vehicle to get in and out of  The standard tubular step bar does make it easier to step up  If this is an issue for you there is optional step sidebars  336    The handles on the inside door pillars can really assist in getting up and into the vehicle b   The new independent rear suspension has improved the ride    of the Ford Explorer  It is a bit of an unusual design where the rear drive shaft passes through a hole in the frame  The rear wheels act independently making for a smoother ride on off road trails  This new design has also allowed for better ground clearance without raising the step up into the driver s seat at least not any worst than it was before b   Speaking of off roading I really like the push button Auto Trac    to switch into four wheel drive  All button controls  A nice feature is the 4x4 automatic feature that runs in four wheel drive but transfers power to the front wheels when the back wheels lose traction     The standard engine offered is a six cylinder engine b    with SOHC and 210 horsepower  A V8 engine can be added as an option  cost  591  Both engines have a overhead cam design  The standard transmission is a 5 speed manual but an automatic is offered as an option  The V8 only comes with an automatic b   Since towing always must be taken into consideration for our family    we found that the standard class 2 towing package has a capacity of 3 500 lbs  Optional class 3 and 4 towing packages on the V6 engine has a towing capacity of 5 500 lbs  336  If you must have more power and towing capacity the V8 engine with the towing upgrade can tow up to 7 000 lbs b   Safety features include a much smarter airbag system b    The air bags deploy knowing the severity of the accident  if the driver had his seat belt on or not and even knows the position of the driver  The optional side airbags  421  cover a full 75  of the side glass  The side air bags work with a roll over sensor that judges how much of a tilt the vehicle has and deploys if a roll over accident occurs  Other standard safety features include the anti lock brakes and an electronic brake force distribution  Child safety locks have been installed b   One feature my husband marveled over b     probably because of my lack of backing up ability  was the optional Reverse Sensing system  217  This system detects when you re backing too close to another vehicle or obstacle and beeps when you re getting to close  It beeps even faster the closer you get  When you get way to close  The tone becomes continuous  Have you ever had the thrill of making a car salesman rather nervous checking out these wonderful new features  Beep Beep  Beep faster beep  About 8 inches a way full tone  I guess he turned funny colors because we were testing it out on the new Expedition     The interior is much more spacious than the 2001 model of the Explorer b    The quality of the interior looks much  richer  than the older models  Many convenient features like the roomy storage tray in the lower console  In the upper console is a really big storage bin  There are a total of three drink holders  There is a good sized map holder with built in bottle holders  I always groan about map holders  I like those map books with all the states and have always had to tuck it between the seat and the console  Now there is a map holder big enough for it b   The visibility from the captain chairs was sensational b    Full view from all sides  It was one of the few vehicles that offers sensational visibility all down the sides and high out the front window  The driver s seat has a manual lumbar adjustment  The lumbar adjustments are a wonderful feature on long trips  The drivers seat offers ten full inches of change all powered by a button b   One feature I have truly learned to love    is the optional power adjustable brakes and accelerator pedals  My nephew s Expedition has this and it is wonderful to be able to adjust the brake and accelerator pedals to your own comfort     The second row of seats provides plenty of legroom and headroom      There is even a ventilation control for the back seat passengers  Behind the passenger seats is 46 cu  ft  of cargo area  There is also an option of having a third row of seats  569  Both the backseat and front seat have 12 volt outlets b   To cover your cargo from view     handy during Christmas shopping  is a pull out covering pulls out from behind the rear seat  You will also find 4 tie down hooks in the cargo area  The rear windows have intermittent washer and wiper blades  There is additional storage under the rear cargo floor     The rear lift gate b    well actually it looks more like a hatch back now is lower  It is much closer to shopping cart level than the old Explorers b   The frame is much stiffer on the 2002 Explorer    making it more stable in cornering and more responsive handling  The wheel base is longer for a less bumpy ride b   The estimated miles per gallon    are 15 city and 20 highway  Base price at  34 055 and the options we would choose  38 000     The 2002 Explorers are much less truck like than the previous models b    The appearance is different it rides much smoother  is much roomier and more comfortable  The 2002 Explorer is quieter  bigger  and safer  Towing shouldn t be a problem especially with the optional class three towing package  The price is middle range for the medium sized SUV s  The engine has the power to pull and tow but is still lacking a bit in the taking off from a dead stop area  Compare to other SUV s the Explorer is much quieter  With the mid sized SUV market flooded  the 2002 Explorer offers many new features that the competitors don t have  The new 2002 4 Wheel Drive Explorer is a nice ride for the price i The Ford Explorer 4WD has four models for 2002  Explorer XLS 4WD  Explorer SLT 4WD  Explorer Limited 4WD  and the Explorer Eddie Bauer 4WD i  
 I  like some other Epinion writers  owned a Dodge Dakota before picking up a used 1997 Ford F 150  So far I have been satisfied with the trucks performance It s a 1997 Ford F 150 XL with the 4 6 V6  Automatic  A C  Tape Deck  Split Bench Seat  Sliding Rear Window  Short Box  Regular Cab  with metallic blue over a grey lower portion  Two wheel drive  The floor is vinyl with no carpet Pros  The truck has excellent visibility  even in the two wheel drive model  The height difference between my little Dodge and the Ford was more than what I expected  The interior of the truck is simple  useful and spacious  This is the first vehicle I have owned where I don t have to put the seat back to the last notch in order to comfortably drive it  The vehicle is equipped with dual airbags and features a shut off control for the passenger unit I use the truck for light hauling  mainly and expeditions into the local junk yards  When serving this duty  the truck has performed like champ  It s agile enough to traverse some of the nastiest junk yard ruts that I have seen  yet sophisticated enough to handle pretty much like a large car on the highway  The good sized 16 inch tires put the truck high enough to avoid most road hazzards In a downpour  the wipers are just fast enough and the lights are bright enough with plenty of left to right illumination so you can see what ever critter might be planning on a kamakazie mission into your path  One thing that my passengers like is the grab handle located on the A pillar  All vehicles should have these  The interior is so expansive there just isn t anything for the passenger to grab on to when the going gets rough so the handle is a great idea Mileage varies on gas quality and the nature of the driving  A steady 55 60 MPH pace on the open road will net you 21 miles to the gallon  Normal mixed city highway use puts us lower at 19 MPG  On a recent rip we fit a full size suitcase BEHIND the seat  and this is a regular cab pickup Maintenance is a breeze  Everything is out in the open and you don t have to jack up the vehicle to change the oil  The oil filter is out in the open  yet protected by the frame  The entire undercarriage of the vehicle is rock solid The V6 has enough power for every day use but it sure isn t a rocket ship  Passing is comfortable and if you put your foot into it she ll take you where you want to go in a hurry  Although  my next truck will have a V8 This is the best selling vehicle in the United States  period  Nothing out sells a Ford F 150  That means parts are plentiful and insurance is pretty cheap Cons  There a couple things I don t like about the truck  The sheet metal on this vehicle is paper thin  My tailgate weights about a ton but the slightest pressure to the metal bows it in and I have put a dent in it by closing the gate with my knee  something I did a thousand times with the Dakota with no ill effect The paint shows every little scratch that you get in it The biggest problem I have had with this vehicle is the rear window would leak in a severe fashion when it rained  A couple of trips to the deal won me a new  tinted  sliding window so all was well in the end but the truck did develop a slightly musty smell that has yet to go away  The jack was also rusted up since it sits under the seat  The truck does have some mystery sounds  like a fairly good clunk in the rear end when it comes to a stop  It also has a noisy A C unit under the hood  something you don t notice with the windows up  I m not worried about either of these simply because I have owned other vehicles in the past that make this one sound as quiet as a Cadillac br br  
 I got my 1993 white Probe when I graduated high school as an off to college present  Since then is has gotten me everywhere I have needed to go with almost no problems  I was even almost totally destroyed in 1995 and rebuilt and it still runs great here in 2000  As a college student who drove the two hours home each weekend I needed a good car that would allow me to do that without trouble  I took drove it half way accross the country when I moved on for graduate school and it still runs great  With it s front wheel drive it handles well in all weather even snow  There has been some wear such as some interior paint peeling on the power window controls but that is to be expected in an 7 year old car  It is not a family car though  The back seat is basically usless for passengers unless they are very small  It rides like a sports car and that is not good for some peoples backs  Onther con is the replacement of bulbs  The bulbs used on this car were intended to never need replacing so when they do it is expensive and they are very hard to find  Most dealerships don t carry them  All and all i would say the probe is very dependable and I convinced my brother to drive one as well  He really liked it unyil someone stole it but that is another story  I have never been disappointed by any aspect of this car   
 my boyfriend got a  99 ford explorer sport last year and since then things have managed to keep going wrong with it  they had to recall it because the power steering could have possibly caused the car to not be able to stop  the rear windshield wiper broke the third week  and the front passenger window wouldn t go down  the car looks great and drives well  as well as an suv can  i guess  but the small problems decrease its appeal  it doesn t get the best gas mileage  but it is very spacious and very quiet on the road  it handles very much like a truck but is comfy and has great speakers and sound  it would be a good car for people active in the outdoors  it has racks on top and is roomy enough to transport equipment  families as well would enjoy this car br br  
 I bought my 95 Ranger Supercab in March of 95  It has been a very good truck although not trouble free  We did have a few minor warranty problems but very few  At 25 700 miles we had the wipers repaired  Then at 40 000 the drivers door open sensor had to be replaced  At about 59 000 miles the air conditioner compressor failed and had to be replaced  The oil pressure transducer was replaced at 61 000 and a leak of transmission fluid developed at 64 500 which was repaired by replacing the shift tower  The only other repair was a cable was replaced for the cruise control at 76 700 miles  All of those repairs were covered by warranty or by the extended warranty which covered the truck to 75 000 miles  Since that the door switch has failed again  The truck is just a bit under powered with the four cylinder engine and the five speed manual transmission  The truck has a truck like  but comfortable ride  The upholstery and interior have held up very well  At this point I would consider keeping the truck for a few more years  It now has 86 000 miles and is going strong Fuel mileage has averaged about 20 miles per gal  for the entire time  We have very carefully had all servicing done on the 5 000 mile interval  as is recommended for light to moderate service  The truck has been driven to and from work in the city by my wife  as well as on extended trips for vacations and weekend travel  On level interstate highways we usually get about 25 mpg  When we replace this truck we will consider another Ranger br br  
 The new 2000 4 Door 4WD Silverado is a true pleasure to drive  When this truck was updated in 1999 I was amazed at the new braking system  4 wheel anti lock disc brakes  roomier  more powerful  more efficient  longer torque curve for towing  etc  This truck re affirmed Chevrolet s dominance of the truck market  Now the 2000 is available with the extended cab fourth door  It is really nice to be able to access the rear of the drivers cabin without having to walk around to the passengers side of the truck  That advantage for me is great because I have two children  so it is nice to not have to lift one child seat over another  Or worse yet  climb over the most comfortable seats you ve ever sat in and get them dirty This truck is more than just the fourth door  The interior room of the drivers cabin is extensive  My personal choice was the front bucket seats  However  you can get it equipped with a front bench seat  one more passenger if that important to you  Foot room is very nice as well as head room  I m 6 2 quot  so I notice these things  The driver can easily access all vehicle information  The drivers message center is concise but offers all pertinent information on the engine  transmission  temperature  and electrical components  I really like the tow haul mode which changes the computers shift mode for the transmission when hauling a heavy load  What this does is reduce transmission wear from unnecessary shifting in and out of higher gears  It also allows for a longer shifting from the lower gears to really pull the available torque from the engine  The torque curve from the 5 3L V8 is longer than it predecessor the 5 7L 350 V8  Plus it has more horsepower  My experience has been that I get 2 to 3 MPG more on the motors The rear seating area is greatly improved from the previous design  The seat is reclined at an 18 degree level  This gives you a much greater back comfort especially on longer trips  You don t feel as though you are setting back on a straight board Some of the little things that I like for example is that you can t lock your keys in the truck if the keys are still in the ignition  You can lock your tailgate using your ignition key  That is really nice if you ever equip your truck with a tonneau cover or a camper top  Speaking of tonneau covers  you can order one from the factory now as an option This is really  quot The Truck quot  as Chevrolet has so branded it  If you want a truck  this is the only one to have  The bonus is that it holds it s re sale value longer and at a greater value than it s competitors Ford and Dodge  Yeah  it costs more than Ford or Dodge  but you get more back in the end  And to use an old adadge from my grandfather   quot You get what you pay for quot  This is the best truck by far br br  
 Are you looking at a few different cars  including the Solara  Do you want a sporty car  but don t want to give up luxury  This is the perfect car for you  I was debating upon a Honda Prelude  Honda Accord V6  Toyota Celica GT S  Acura Integra Type R  and a nice big Dodge Ram SBWB  I took a trip to the Toyota lot to take a peak at the GT S  and take it for a test drive  Once the doctor removed my legs so I could fit into the Celica  definitely not a car for tall people  I looked behind me and saw this wonderful creature  This was the first time I had ever seen the Toyota Solara  I got out of the Celica  asked the sales person if I could test drive that  and well  bummer  it was sold  the last one on the lot The dealer told me he could set me up the next day with a test drive of the Toyota Solara SE 4cyl automatic  and I said ok  I drove the car  This was a real base model  As soon as I got in the car  and then got in the back seat  I was amazed  I could fit into the back seat  without the front seat touching my knee s  I still had a LOT of room  I was extremely excited about this car The Prelude was ok  but it was a 4 cylinder  The Accord V6 had the 6 cylinder  but was only available in automatic  The GT S was way too cramped for me  the Integra was small  yet quick  no torque though  and the big ol  Dodge Ram cost too much to do customizable things to  such as new hood  bigger tires  etc  The Solara was available in a v6  5 speed  and was located 30 miles away  I had the dealer ship it over  and I drove it  and bought it that night The Solara has superior torque  and has the get up and move power you would expect from a v6  The seating  to my surprise  was leather  The form I had filled out said the car would be cloth  The leather is so comfortable  and the car is just perfect  The sound system is tremendous  and the sun roof is outstandingly quiet  The car has so many features  for instance  the headlights will turn themselves on at night  and off when you get out of the car  accessories will have 45 seconds to run  for closing windows  sunroof  etc  after the car is turned off  or until a door is opened This is definitely the car for you if you want luxury  and sport  combined  If I had to break the luxury sport into a ratio  I would have to use 100 0  because this is an all luxury  all sports car  all the time  either way you want it  I just can t wait until I get my TRD Supercharger UPDATE  I just had my alarm installed   1 000 total  Man those things are expensive NEWER UPDATE As requested  I am going to give some basic statistics about the car Body Style  Convertable  Coupe  both 5 passenger cars Engine  Front Drive  Front wheel drive Air Bags  Dual front airbags  side airbags optional Engine  4 cylinder engine  optional  and recommended  200hp v6 Transmission  available in 5 speed manual  SE Model only  or automatic  all models Acceleration  0   60mph acceleration  7 1s Distance acceleration  standing  from a stopped position  1 4 mile  15 6s 90 4mph Fuel Economy  21m 28m  city highway  Although people have boasted using synthetic oil  and premium gasoline  being able to reach 32m highway The price ranges from 21k to 32k There are also several TRD  Toyota Racing Development  parts for this car  The Supercharger has performance boosts raising the 200hp to 343hp  For general information about this car  read above br br  
 1998 Ford Mustang GT Coupe 4 6L V8 Engine 5 speed Manual transmission Keyless entry Leather Seats Mach sound system CD Player  Cassette  6 speakers rear spoiler 17 inch alloy wheels power drivers seat power everything I am on my third car  and haven t been really happy with a car purchase until now  Recently I purchased a 1998 Ford Mustang GT Coupe  It came fully loaded  with premium sound package  leather  ABS  keyless entry  power everything  I opted for a manual transmission for obvious reasons  The car is an absolute joy to drive  The manual transmission and GT engine make it really smoke  and the performance tires grip and hug the road  The car really gets noticed  but its kinda flashy and might attract the wrong kind of attention  The leather interior is beautiful  but the conditions are kind of cramped  There isn t much legroom for tall guys like me  and the backseat is only there for the insurance discount  The audio quality from the stereo is excellent  and having CD and cassette is really convenient  There are 6 speakers overall  and the two rear speakers are each driven by their own amplifier  By buying a late model used car  I saved a whopping 30  for a car that only had 26 000 miles on it  and was in excellent condition  Kelly s blue book listed the car s value at  19 500  while I paid only  17 999  The only drawback was losing a large chunk of the warranty  Honestly though  the savings are worth it  and I rarely used the warranty on my previous vehicles  Yes  they are flashy  but Mustangs in general offer a lot of bang for their buck  Especially when you compare to foreign models like Hondas  Mitsubishi Eclipses  Toyota Celicas  These cars typically are priced higher with inferior options and smaller engines  Why buy a 2000 Eclipse with optional V6 engine for  24 000  when you can have a 2000 Mustang GT with a high output V8 for the same price     
 Bottom line  This is such a fun car to drive  My RSX is still less than three weeks old and I almost have 900 miles on it  My car is the base model with leather and no extra options I loved the look of the exterior of the car  Very sleek and sporty on the outside and very comfortable on the inside  The rear lights are large  circular  and bright  looks like a Nissan Skyline from behind at night  The front headlights are also large  very bright and vastly improved from the Integra  The front underbody spoiler also looks very nice  16 inch alloy wheels are standard  Front and rear intermittent windshield wipers are standard  Also comes with power sunroof and sunshade  and cruise control The interior is fabulous  The dashboard and gauges are bright red at night  It is visually stunning  The seats are racing style  which means that there is no adjustable headrest  but the seat is very comfortable  It fits just right with my back and arms so I think anyone could find this comfortable  The temperature gauges are very unique looking  they are shaped like knobs  The sound system is AM FM CD standard with 6 speakers  I drive the automatic transmission which also comes with Sequential Sportshift which is an electronically controlled manual transmission  Switch it to  M  and you can shift up or down without the use of a clutch  There is also a very good amount of leg room for the driver and passenger  The back is decent for a sports car and has comparable leg room of a small sedan like a Toyota Corolla  The is not much headroom for tall people in the back though  And only two can fit in the back  The trunk is very roomy and the back seats can fold down for more space My RSX  Base model  has a 2 0 liter i VTEC with 160 horsepower and 141 lbs ft torque  So obviously it is powerful  The steering is very easy and the car responds and handles well  However  the car turns at a very wide angle so some sharp turns are difficult to make on one try  ABS is standard as are disc brakes so braking is very powerful  It accelerates well  0 60 in about 8 seconds  Gas mileage is above average  24 city  31 highway  Security system with ignition disable and keyless entry are also standard  The keys are also special in that they contain a special electronic circuit code  If you don t use the factory key to start the car  the car will disable the fuel and will not allow the car to start  The radio also will not work if it is removed from the car As you ve probably read so far  many features come standard on this car even though it is only the base model  The base without leather is around  20 000  Mine with leather was  20 700 after negotiating  before tax  There are only a few options available and the only one I got was a leather interior  Some other options that you can get are fog lights and rear spoiler  Ever since I laid my eyes on this car  I knew I wanted it  and finally I got it  It is also backed up by the quality and reliability of the Honda Acura name  It is a powerful car and can accelerate very well  So when I go out  I have a ton of fun driving and blasting music with the windows and sunroof open  You will get many envious looks from being in this car  
 The Ford Expedition was the first SUV I ve ever had in my lifetime  and I ve never been so satisfied with a car  We first bought the car in 1998 so trips up to Lake Tahoe would be easier in the winter  since we wouldnt have to put the chains on the wheels  The car handles VERY well and the turning circle is magnificent for a large vehicle  ITs easy to maneuver in city streets and go zoomin  on insterstate freeways  Now exactly WHY do I love the expedition so much  Thats a dumb question  Its because you tower above all the small cars and I feel mighty and powerful  also the advantage that if someone is driving poorly and decides to cut you off  chances are their car will get more damage than the expedition There were a few problems with our expedition  though  There was something wrong with the engine  We found this out the hard way  New years eve 1998  and we are in Tahoe on our way back to the lodge from a party  Why yes  our car breaks down  Stranded on the side of the road  we spent our new years watching the tow truck guy lift the truck onto the big flatbed After two more engines  the car was up and running again  this took 2 months  The warranty handled all the money  and ford paid for all of the engines  So basically  we didn t spend a dime  Ford also paid for the  200 out of  300 it took for the tow company to tow our car back to the bay area  Besides that  the car is great  Leather seats  6 cd holder  amazing bass and tremble for the sound system  its a great car to haul your friends around in  Whether your going up to the snow  or to the inner city   it always drives well and smoothly  And its guaranteed a cozy ride So I  as a proud owner of an expedition  I recommend this car to all types of people  Whether you are the business  country  or trendy type   its great for it all  Hauling your co workers to a meeting  going to the snow to ski snowboard  or just go and hang out with friends  So if your looking into SUV  please check out the expedition   for its worth the test drive br br  
 My Ford Focus ZX3  5 speed manual  though a scant 6 mos  old  is a never ending source of regret  In the ensuing 4 500 miles  the car has been at the dealership for fifteen days  and their alleged  quot fixes quot  never took  The transmission problems remain  even after replacing nearly every major component therein  cluster shaft  input shaft  4 main bearings  And let s not forget to mention the dealer inflicted body damage requiring the repairing and repainting of a front quarter panel  Ford Service Managers  Customer Service Mangers  and Regional Representatives are no help  Too many problems  too many phone calls  too many trips to the dealership  too many meaningless apologies  If my experiences are any indication  anyone who values their hard earned money should steer clear of the Focus  and of Ford  You can bet that in the future  I will br br  
 I used to own a 2001 Mustang convertible but had a terrible experience with the dealership  not the car  and fortunately got them to buy the car back  it was THAT bad  I might review this experience in the Mustang section I decided to give Ford a second chance and since in the meantime I had adopted a 100lbs  dog I decided to take a look at bigger vehicles  With the Ford Escape in mind I went to a different dealership  While leaving the lot to take a Midnight Edition Escape I glanced at a bunch of little Focus Station Wagons and finally left the dealer in one of those The dealer had none of these wagons with manual transmission  traction control or airbags  so despite the fact that I was willing to pay the extra cash for such features I had to leave the lot in an automatic Ford Focus ZTW  This was way back in August and since the car is almost 5000 miles old I believe I can make a fair review The car is very well equipped for the money  Lots of space and nice unexpected features everywhere  Although the engine power is rather modest the wagon is kind of fun to drive due to great on road dynamics  Fuel economy not as good as advertised but pretty decent and improving with time  Now its making about 23 mpg So far I have not experienced any of the problems and mechanical failures that many people have reported here  Just a very annoying squicky noise in the rear that hopefully the dealership will be able to take care of when taken to the 5K service The front wheels are permanently dirty due to fast fading brake pads I suspect but so far the braking power has been adequate and enough I really like the instrumentation and the interior design  There is storage space everywhere in the cabin  Inside  the car feels much larger than it actually is  The only objection to the interior would be that the seat cushions feels short  I am only 5 148 and not heavy and in long rides the seat makes its presence known  I mean a seat cushion is not something you should think about unless its really good  I don 146t want to think how a larger guy would feel after an hour in one of these My dog loves the car and hopefully the trauma of riding in the minimalist back seat of the Mustang is forgotten and forgiven The other day I was looking at a sales brochure for the European Ford Focus and couldn 146t believe how spartan the American version is when compared to the one over there  Features like climate control  better headlights  chrome inside door handles  hood lock  backseats headrests  No wonder is the best selling car in Europe The initial quality problems plus the failure to offer many of the features offered in Europe cemented Focus 146 reputation as a very unreliable cheapmobile  bad for Ford and even worse for the owners whose resale value will be greatly affected  I own a 2002 version in which most of the problems supposedly have been already addressed but I suspect that such fact will be of little help when the time comes to get rid of my ZTW  In the meantime I am enjoying the ride and the money saved Focus is a very good car that Ford consciously failed to make a great car  Only they know why  
 After driving sport utilities for years  we decided it was time for a change of pace  We had tons of trouble with our Explorer s transmission  and the Blazer was a gas guzzler  We decided to go for a change of pace when choosing our current family vehicle  and opted for a smaller car We bought our 1998 Ford Escort off of a local individually owned car lot  for around  9 000  This was almost a year ago  and I remember the day we found her just like it was yesterday  Now we aren t talking about your old  almost grotesque style Escorts  They have defiantly evolving into a quite slick body style  There she sat  gun metal grey with a sports fin attached  A very rounded and contoured car with 2 doors  I was attracted immediately   Being a woman  and not knowing a whole lot about cars  I choose based on looks  then the hubby verifies the mechanical shape of the car  We decided to take the Escort for a test drive  When I got in  I noticed it was kind of small in the backseat  The front is okay  but the back is cramped for space  I didn t let this discourage me however  I was already to in love with the rounded instrument panel in the middle of the dash  Very modern looking to me compared to the simple styling of the SUV s I d been used to driving  Needless to say  the car drove like a dream  and after my better half looked under the hood and made a few comments on the motor being  quite clean   and a few other things I don t know anything about  we took her home with us It s been a year  and we ve haven t been to the garage for anything more than an oil change  We get great gas mileage  and the ride is very smooth and stable  The steering and handling is tight  and I feel safer with the dual airbags  Our Escort hasn t given us one ounce of trouble  except for that less than spacious back seat  The kids constantly kick me in the back  which is a big annoyance I would recommend this car to anyone  unless you are exceptionably tall  or tend to haul older kids or adults in the back seat  While we are okay now  when the boys get bigger  we will have to upgrade to something more spacious  until then I will continue to enjoy the reliability of my 1998 Ford Escort  
 In 1990 I bought a brand new Ford Ranger Supercab  I bought a Ford because I had previously owned Ford trucks and had always been satisfied with them  I bought a supercap because I had 2 small children at the time and the jump seats in the extended cab area were perfect for them  The truck was big enough to hold the whole family and at the same time it was very economical  I did have some initial breaking in problems with the truck but once all the bugs were worked out of it it was great  Even though this was a small vehilce it drove much like a full size truck and was extremely comfortable  I would recomend that anyone with small children or no children to buy a Ford Ranger  I kept mine until 1998 and it had 135 thousand miles when i sold it  I would not recomend this truck to families with more than 2 small kids br br  
 This car or should I call it truck has many positives  As one of the biggest vehicles on the road the driver sees the road from a better vantagepoint than most other cars and trucks even  The suburban is a powerhouse of a car capable of taking its driver on anything from an offroad journey to a short weekend getaway  With its 8 seats and large trunk it has plenty of room for most families and their luggage It also has luxurious features like heated front seats and rear control for the air conditioning system  It is a great car but you have to be willing to pay the price for it  It not only costs alot to buy but it only gets around 13 m g in town and maybe 16 m g on the highway br br  
 I recently purchased the Landrover Discover SII  I took the Rover for a off road testdrive and loved the way the vehicle rumbled through the mud and climbed over the hills  The Rover has the class of it s own  It looks great from any side of the road  ignore those people who says it s a box  It has a killer sound system with 320 watts and it takes the corners with ease better than some of the highly priced cars  The seats are comfortable with tilting armrest and three types of adjustments  The rear seats are auditorium type gives a better view to the passengers  The cargo room is sufficient enough for a stroller and big suitcase and some small items  Handles great comfortable and puts you above everyone on the road including other SUV s  Although I do not plan to take it off road regularly I enjoy my daily ride to work  The front and rear sunroof and the additional train roof windows give you all the view you want to the outside  I wish the sunroofs slides a bit more  Highly recommends br br  
 My last three vehicles have been leased  all have been Ford products  I started out with a  95 Mustang  After having our baby we decided we needed a larger vehicle and went with the  97 Explorer  The lease expired  we when in to purchase it and found out we could get a  99 Expedition for a smaller payment  of course we went for it We love our Expedition and will turn this lease into a purchase  no need to upgrade to a Excursion  We decided on this vehicle because we were planning on expanding our family a few more times  with a child and a very large dog  a Newfoundland  We already have one toddler and a 100 pound yellow lab and there is still room for more Our Expedition is the 4WD XLT Model  sure we would have loved the Bauer Edition  but the extra s were not enough to convince us to pay almost  6000 more  The seating is very comfortable in both the front and back with lots of leg room  almost too much  I would have shortened the leg room in the back seat and made a little more room in the third seat area  That would be my only complaint about the Expedition  but the again what are  quot Thule quot  racks for  We comfortably took 2 adults  4 children  one in a car seat  our dog  and luggage for all on a long trip and everyone was comfortable br br  
 MY EXPERIENCE I test drove a Saturn Ion 2 5 speed sedan at a local dealership  My test drive lasted over half an hour  and covered city streets  winding secondary roads  and the freeway  PERFORMANCE A theme which you ll quickly notice developing in this review is that Saturn got all the big stuff right with the Ion  but tends to hiccup on the details  For example  the engine  The Ion s 2 2 liter four cylinder is torquey and robust feeling  and it provided plenty of low end grunt for effortless around town acceleration on my test drive  When I wound up the engine on a freeway on ramp  it provided healthy midrange response and pulled the car up to speed with ease  But eager it s not there s something about this engine that makes the revs climb and fall with sloth like lethargy  as if the flywheel was two sizes too big  The power is there  but the engine doesn t zing to the redline like those in the Honda Civic and Mazda 3  TRANSMISSION CLUTCH The Ion s transmission was also a mixed bag  On one hand  I loved the shifter  Its throws were short  and its gates well defined  so the lever thunked from gear to gear with reassuring solidity and precision  But the clutch was a bit disappointing  It has a short throw  which should make it feel sporty  but its vague take up makes it difficult to change gears smoothly  As much as I liked the transmission s shift action  the jerky starts resulting from the tricky clutch take up were a bit embarrassing  Maybe it would get easier with familiarity  something I admittedly had little opportunity to build on my half hour test drive  STEERING HANDLING This is the area where the Ion s  big stuff right  little stuff wrong  dichotomy reaches its peak  Good news first  the Ion s chassis is a solid and capable handler  Its suspension kept body lean well controlled in tight corners  and the tires provided plenty of grip on twisty roads  Driven hard  the Ion felt more surefooted and confident than most of its economy car rivals  But the bad news is that the Ion s steering is among the worst I ve experienced in a new car  It s an electrically assisted system  as opposed to the hydraulic systems in most cars  and the software needs some rethinking to give it the natural feeling response of more conventional setups  Its weighting is feather light  and its ratio is extremely quick meaning that it takes very little effort or movement to turn the wheels  This is great for one finger parking  but the system is also more than a little vague around the straight ahead position  making the Ion feel touchy and nervous on the road  On the freeway  the steering required what I consider more than acceptable concentration to avoid zig zagging in my lane  I ll admit that I m a stickler for steering feel  so this flaw may not seem as glaring to most drivers as it did to me  But if I were actually in the market for another new car  the Ion s misguided steering would have been enough to prevent me from purchasing it  The silver lining here is that  since the system is electric and not hydraulic  it will be far easier for Saturn to reprogram it and make improvements to it in the near future  RIDE Here s one aspect of the Ion that is unquestionably positive  The Ion had an excellent ride  with a suspension that managed to smother bumps effectively while maintaining good control of body motions  There was a bit more floating over dips and rises than you d find in a Honda Civic  but it never became uncomfortably bouncy  and most buyers will appreciate the added softness  Road and wind noise were kept to a minimum  which gave the Ion a very quiet freeway ride  The engine became a bit vocal when I revved it hard  but under normal circumstances it was pleasantly muted  These solid  quiet ride characteristics gave the Ion a  big car  feel that lent it a sense of quality  INTERIOR The automotive press has griped at length about the Ion s youthful  forward looking cabin  but I had no such complaints  In fact  I liked the Ion s interior more than those of most other cars in its class  Where most economy cars strive for a simple  familiar interior design that is unlikely to offend anyone s aesthetic sensibilities  the Ion surrounds its driver in funky  modern styling that may have less mass appeal  but is considerably more interesting  The Ion s dashboard is molded in warm sand dune colors  and it was covered in unusual dimpled textures that were pleasing to my Gen Y aethetic sense  The plastics felt hard and a bit cheap in places  but there was nothing egregious in evidence  The Ion s gauge pod is mounted in the center of the dashboard  instead of directly in front of the driver  and while some people dislike this feature  I appreciated the wide open  unobstructed view forward that the relocated gauges provide  There were only two weak points in the Ion s interior  One is the seats  which were far from uncomfortable  but felt a bit short on padding and support  The other was the thoroughly aggravating shift light  which illuminated in bright orange every time I exceeded 2500 rpms  Driving that way helps save gas  which I m all for  but sometimes acceleration is nice too like when you re merging with freeway traffic  If I want to be told when to shift  I ll drive an automatic  OK    PRACTICALITY The Ion meets or surpasses its competition in this area  as well  The interior felt roomy and provided plenty of space for passengers  The rear seat  in particular  seemed uncommonly spacious for an economy sedan  The trunk also provided unexpected capacity  and standard split folding rear seats allow you to expand the cargo area for bulkier loads  One other feature I appreciated was the height adjustable driver s seat  which is standard on the Ion 2 trim level  RELIABILITY Consumer Reports rates the Ion s reliability Above Average  and did the same for its predecessor  the S series  Saturn s small cars seem to be pretty trouble free machines  so you re not likely to get into trouble here  OVERALL Despite the negativity of much of my review  I really wanted to love the Saturn  and give it my whole hearted recommendation  The simple reason was that the customer service at the Saturn dealership was hands down the best I have ever experienced  Being a car obsessed college student  I go to a whole lot of dealerships to drive new cars  and put up with the same shtick at each and every one  A salesperson accosts me within seconds of arriving on the lot  rushes me through a test drive  and upon returning to the dealership  sends me into the manager s lair for a more thorough interrogation  These have been the tactics at nearly every dealership I ve been to except Saturn s  At the Saturn dealer  what I found was a lot full of unlocked cars  without a single prowling salesperson to be found  I poked around the interior of the car I drove for at least fifteen minutes  with no harassment  When I was just about to start looking for a salesperson can you imagine someone walked up and asked if I needed any help  When I asked for a test drive  he said   A test drive  Sure  Here s the key  Take your time  just call if you re going to be more than a half hour  Oh  and while you re out  try to take some city streets and some freeways  too  so you really get a feel for how it drives  I was stunned  And I certainly had plenty of time to get a feel for the way the Ion drives  although the unfortunate answer is  not spectacularly  The onslaught of aggravations from the steering and drivetrain dooms the Ion to automotive mediocrity in my view  despite its strengths in other areas  So it comes down to this  what s more important to you  the driving experience or the buying experience  If your biggest concern is avoiding pushy and confrontational salespeople  Saturn is the way to go  If you re more concerned with the car itself  you may want to keep looking  
 The original reason I leased my 1998 Toyota Corolla LE was the no money down  first payment and I drive off the lot deal  I also was impressed with my sales person  she did not show me the vanity mirror  and did not treat me like a kid  This is my first  quot brand new quot  car I have been impressed with this car from day 1  I have not had any problems thus far   granted it only has like 25k miles  but I have only had to replace a hubcap  my fault  and oil changes  windshield wipers etc  My car is extremely quiet  even when I bring it up to 80mph on the highway  It is quite peppy for a four cyl   I have a 5 spd manual transmission model  My only complaints are that it is on the small side  even with the wood trim interior the interior is kind of plain  and the factory sound system could be upgraded I would consider keeping the car at the end of my lease  but I am making more   now  and I want a bigger car  I would recommend this car to any first time new car buyer  and anyone who wants a very reliable car for not a lot of cash br br  
 Hello my name is Bodie  I bought the ford focus hatchback  There were several reasons I did  The first  was that I had an American truck  And  by knowing this  I knew that Ford would give me a better deal on the the trade in  Also  because I wanted a car  A small car  One that is quick easy to drive and gets good gas mileage  The Ford Focus is all of that and more  What I love about the Focus  is its futuristic body style  In my opinion it is very original  Plus  the stereo for a factory unit is very good  I have no complaints there  It s very roomy and more foot and storage space compared to it s counterpart the Honda Civic  The Focus also has a larger and more powerful engine  I really don t have any complaints on the car  as of yet  but we will see So far  it has got the job done and that is to get me to work  and not spend a lot of money on gas  The people who should buy the car  are people who are looking to spend a lot of money and are looking for a sporty  reliable car     
 Last year  2000  in early summer  I had just gotten off some bad experiences with older cars  and my wife and I were down to sharing one vehicle  It was time for a newer vehicle with a warranty  and my income was enough to justify a car payment  I looked at a wide variety of vehicles under  20k  when we came across a dealer with 2 Cruisers in the showroom  My wife and I loved it  and I realized that since I commute by public transportation  the wait for the car didn t rule it out  So I put in the order  at  2500 over MSRP  and was supposed to wait for about 8 months  At the time  I thought I might have to relocate to the republik of Kalifornia  so I asked if I could order it with 50 state emissions equipment  They didn t know  and the call back I got was from a different dealer  5 star rated no less  It turns out this other dealer was way better  and a friend of mine gave glowing reports of service when he bought a minivan there  Not only that  but they could sell me the car for only about  80 more  and get it to me in half the time  Their markup was  3000  but somehow the other dealer had padded the sale price  Needless to say  I switched my order to them Jump to now  I m driving the base package model in black  with only the sunroof group and auto transmission as options  They all have power windows  but power locks are part of an expensive security keyless entry package that I didn t want  so I have installed a nice aftermarket car alarm and power door lock kit  I not only pay less  but have the ability to automatically roll up all windows when arming the alarm  very handy  wish they all did that The car is obviously gorgeous  and it s quite versatile and practical to boot  the rear seats come out or fold up  leaving lots of space to haul things  I just recently stacked a bunch of furniture from Ikea in there  and still got decent highway mileage  But the mileage isn t spectacular  you rarely break 21 MPG  I ve only just put 6000 miles on it  since I don t commute in the thing and own a motorcycle now  The automatic transmission was probably not the best choice  I figured since it had a hefty sized 4 cylinder motor  it would do better than most compacts with an automatic  but its weight works against that theory  It s not bad at all  but every time it downshifts to maintain speed on a hill I remember why I usually don t like automatic transmissions  But most people don t like driving a clutch  especially in rush hour  so if you like autos  this one is fine  Just pop it down into 3rd when you hit a hill on the highway  Handling is adequate  but under a hard turn  even a cloverleaf ramp  you can tell it ain t no Honda  It s noticeably top heavy for a passenger car  but far from scary in the turns like an SUV  And it rides so much more smoothly  of course All in all  it s a great car for the money  very pleasant to drive  great looking  and well built  No real complaints except for the high car payment and insurance rates I didn t used to have    I think I ll sell it in another year  just to avoid paying for a car with no more warranty  The novelty is wearing off  too  so it s not as unique on the road as it was when I got it  
 Just the name Toyota should be enough I have always owned Toyotas  They seem to be extremely dependable with very little maintenance  I recently leased a Toyota Corolla  I have a 4 year old daughter and when considering which car to lease  one of my concerns was   of course safety  This car not only has the usual air bags in front but also on the sides of both the driver and passenger seats  The engine in this car is terrific For a 4 cylinder it has quite kick to it  The only thing I do wish is that it had a little more room in the back area  When my daughter is riding with me in her car seat it seems she can t help but hit the back of my seat with her feet  Another thing is I would have liked to put her car seat in the middle  to protect her better but it doesn t seem to sit properly  Overall this is a great car for the price  If you are looking for reliability this is the car for you br br  
 First of all  let me say that if you are a driving enthusiast  this truck is for you  The 1993 95 Ford F 150 Lightning has been called a Mustang GT with a huge trunk  It has excellent acceleration and handling for a truck that weights a hefty 4400 lbs  or so Likes Exclusivity  There were less than 12 000 F 150 Lightning s made between the years of 1993 and 1995  My F 150 Lightning is one of 2280 made in 1995  I like driving a vehicle that not everyone has Handling  I still get a huge smile on my face after accelerating through a sharp curve  This has to be my favorite aspect of this truck  The suspension of the  93 95 F 150 Lightning has been thoroughly reworked  The front suspension has been lowered 1 0 inch and has a 1 0 inch stabilizer bar  The rear suspension has been lowered 2 5 inches and also has a 1 0 inch stabilizer bar  The Lightning also has an extra half leaf spring in front of the rear axle to act as a  slapper  bar to help eliminate wheel hop when under hard acceleration  Motor Trend tested the Lightning and recorded 0 89g of lateral grip in a controlled skid pad test with spikes up to 1 0g  These kinds of numbers are incredible for a car to achieve and flat out amazing for a truck Engine  The F 150 Lightning is equipped with a 351 cu  in  Windsor engine   That is 5 8 liters for you metric types  I love this engine  It may not be as smooth as modern over head cam engines but the throw you back into the set acceleration is incredible  The engine received the normal hot rodder tricks  The heads have bigger valves  1 84 in  for the intake and 1 54 in  for the exhaust  The intake system has equal length  tuned  tubular runners and the exhaust system consists of stainless steel headers and true dual stainless steel exhaust pipes  This entire setup works together to generate 240 hp and 340 ft lbs  of torque  The Lightning performance numbers are as follows  0 60 mph in 7 6 sec  and quarter miles times of 15 2 sec  This may not seem fast as compared to other cars but remember this is a very heavy truck The Looks  The  93 95 F 150 Lightning is very conservative in its appearance  The only distinguishing features are the lowered stance  huge wheels  17x8 in  wheels with 275 60HR 17 tires  and small air dam with fog lights under the front bumper  You could order the Lightning in any color you wanted as long as it was Red  Black  and White  Mine is black and even though it looks good when it is washed and waxed it is hard to keep it that way  The Interior  The interior is gray with charcoal colored seats  I love those seats  They are very supportive and comfortable for long trips  and they have adjustable lumbar and bolster support  The bolster support really helps when you are blasting through sharp curves  Usefulness  Even though this is a sport truck it can still be used to do truck duties  The amount of weight that can be put in the bed of the truck is reduced to around 750 lbs   because the truck is lowered  but the truck can still tow 5 000 lbs  which is more than enough for the average truck owner Dislikes The gas mileage  This truck sucks gas like it is going out of style especially during spirited driving maneuvers  The EPA rating for the truck is 12 mpg city and 16 mpg highway  Thank goodness the truck has two gas tanks  a 16 gallon tank and a 19 gallon tank  although the wallet does tend to hurt after filling up both tanks The ride  This is different from the handling  The ride of the truck is very stiff  If you are on smooth roads you are ok  but if you have to drive on rough roads be prepared  You can feel every bump and pebble in the road All in all this is an excellent truck  Every time I drive my F 150 Lightning I smile  I sometimes turn the radio off when I drive just because the truck sounds so good under acceleration  If you are a driving enthusiast and your vehicles are more than just basic transportation look into getting a Lightning  The 1999 and 2000 model Lightning s are even more fun with 360 supercharged horse power and 440 ft  lbs  of torque  I bought my F 150 Lightning used with 27 000 miles and I have driven it to 56 000 trouble free miles     
 Acura s Integra Coupe is undoubtedly one of the best sport cars on the market  There are numerous aspects about the car that are either  quot Love  em or Leave  em quot  But  overall  the car is still kicking it with the best of them on the market as of date  All one has to do is drive this sporty little coupe to instantly fall in love with it  The way it corners  suctioning to the road  to the way it races down the streets of any street  the driver will immediately recognize the strengths that this trendy little car offer  The interior is roomy enough for the driver and front passenger and the Integra s customizable options are enough to excite anyone  However  the only real disappointment with the car is that somewhat outdated body style  Apparently Acura is planning on changing this in the coming years so we may not have to wait too much longer for a trendier exterior to match it s interior  The only other complaint is the lack of room for back seat passengers  but I suppose that s why they are only a  quot sport coupe quot  Overall  this is an incredible car that anyone would be fortunate to own br br  
 I am the owner of a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac  Ford did good with this one  I don t buy new cars very often  and this is the first Ford vehicle I have ever owned  The Sport Trac handles well  has a comfortable car like ride  some 4 X 4 s I drove reminded me of being in an off road jeep  It currently has 1288 miles on it and I have not had to take it back to the dealer for any warranty work  no squeaks  leaks pings or noises  I can take 4 people anywhere  the back seat is comfy and roomy  and I can also haul my gardening supplies in the truck bed  I don t really pull boats or trailers   I d buy an F 150 for that  but this vehicle really fits my lifestyle  And         unlike the japanese vehicles  it has plenty of cupholders  One test drive sold me So     if you like to garden  carry supplies back and forth to the office  live in a climate where it snows  need to take more than one person at a time and like to get a lot of looks       buy a Sport Trac They are cool br br  
 My wife and I bought a 1996 Ford Club Wagon Chateau in Feb  2000 because we needed the expansion room  and my wife has always wanted a van  She wanted a van that she could drive  but wasn t too hard to park  Well  the van is great but DON T try to squeeze it into small lots What we got for  14 000 was a Extremely full sized van with room for 7 passengers  The two seats behind the front are captain s chairs  and one bench seat  The bench seat is removable or convertible to a twin size  mattress  The side windows are IMMENSE  and provide our two year old with the best view  We bought a non customized version with the V 8 5 8L engine  It has plenty of power for passing  and towing  It also has power seats and windows  but not much else in amenities We all love the roomy interior and the color  We also love the dual air controls and the way it handles  It drives more like our Taurus than a van  We don t like the mileage it gets on road driving  especially since gas is now  1 60 in Michigan Driving this van is very easy  easier than expected  Since the mirrors are so large  they give an excellent view behind you  Combined with the huge side windows  there is only on  Blind spot  directly behind the van if they tailgate you All in all  a very good buy for families and anyone needing a LOT of room  
 My husband owns a 1993 Ford Thunderbird and it has caused us nothing but a headache and has put a whole in our bank account  At 38 000 miles he had a problem with the electrical system  At 40 000 miles he had to have all of the brakes and drums and etc  replaced in which was a cost of 1 000 00 at 42 000 miles the head gaskets blew the cost to repair this was 2 500 00  Now there is 52 000 miles and two of the motor mounts need to be replaced  the driver side door won t stop chiming when you have the lights on  The molding on the drivers side is coming off  I know my husband isn t to blame for these problems because he babies his cars and he is a very excellent driver  This car does have excellent pickup  handles uphill with ease  When driving in rain or snow the rear end tends to sway while making turns  The interior is very spacious  seats five with enough extra space to seat six  even if all the passengers were six feet tall  The trunk space is very spacious The long roomy look this car has is very appealing but once you own one it s not worth it s looks br br  
   Updated on 3 25 2003  Boo Explorer  As you can see from below  we originally loved the new Explorer  However  after owning the vehicle for about 3 years  our feeling toward Explorer  and toward Ford  turned around completely Every since after the first year  we have been experiencing a multitude of problems  Car won t start  tires were recalled  alarm does not work  just to name some  The dealer s repair shop are not much helpful either  Most small problems require two or more visits because they  couldn t duplicate the problem Recently  we believe we have a transmission problem  I say believe because after paying  89 at the dealer for diagnostic  the result was inconclusive  Get this  if we really want to find the problem  we have to pay the  2000 to take the transmission components apart  The car is still relatively new  with less than 30 000 miles  So transmission problem is the last thing I expected In short  I do not recommend Ford  I will not buy another Ford  I will not repair my car at their dealer  and probably any dealer after warrantee  Hope this is helpful to anyone other there considering a used Ford Explorer  Try something else Originally written in Dec 30  1999  Go Explorer  My wife and I purchased the vehicle in the summer of this year  We decided on a SUV so we have something bigger  safer  and different than our other vehicle  We test drove Toyota 4Runner and Nissan Pathfinder  Explore is noiser than both cars  but we find the handling to be smoother  Explore feels heavier and hence  perhaps false  a sense of security  The acceleration is comparable  and the gas mileage is slightly higher than 4Runner  In addition to 4Runner and Pathfinder  I also drove Chevrolet Blazer and Isuzu Rodeo extensively  In the end  we chose Explore because of these reasons 1  Other than GM s Jeep and Isuzu Trooper  Explorer has the longest history on the market  To me  the brand provides stability and quality 2  Much better handling than Rodeo and Blazer  Rodeo s rear windshield wiper broke a few times  3  Easy to engage 4 wheel drive on Explorer  since it s always on auto  4  Explorer offers an excellent package of feature  quality  and performance  5  Explorer provided the most attractive package  At the time of purchasing the vehicle  the interest rate was 2 9  for 4 years with  500 rebate  Hence  the purchase was a breeze  There are a few problems with Explorer  but none are too major  Surprisingly  one of our complaint is front passenger space  The driver s seat feel crampy  and we are not that big of people  Second  something does feel right with the starter  Sometimes it take more than one try to get it working   Note  The roominess scale doesn t have my complaint  so I chose the closest match  which is 4 In conclusion  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyway who are interested in purchasing a SUV with a good blend of price  feature  performance  and safety  
 I have recently purchased a 1999 Ford F 150 and thought I would share my opinion on it  This is a very reliable vehicle  however  the 4 2L V 6 engine makes it a little too light for any real work  If you are going to purchase a F 150  the Triton V 8 is a must  It has a lot of room behind the seat  but if you are going to have more than two people in the vehicle  then a super cab would be a wiser investment  as the middle passenger gets very uncomfortable on long trips  This is a solid truck with lots of space in the back  The fuel economy is average  around 20mpg  The warranty seems good on it  but I will update that if I ever have to use it  The handling on this truck is supurb  although it took a few days to get used to  The 5 speed transmission handles quite good  but I m sure an automatic is just as good  Overall  I would have to give this vehicle a 7 out of 10 as it is a little too light for my liking  and now that I m in it I wish I had a 4x4    
 I 146ve never owned a pickup  and possibly never will  But I just had to drive the redesigned Ford F 150 as soon as it appeared on dealers  lots  Why  Ford s financial health has been shaky lately  and no product is more critical to this health than the company s full size pickup  the F 150  This truck  the best selling vehicle in the U S  for the last quarter century  contributes a major chunk of Ford s sales and profits  Consequently  as goes the new truck  so goes the company  Well aware of the stakes  Ford spared little when fully redesigning its large pickup for 2004   Partly as a result  the new F 150 is much more expensive to build than the old one  Given the importance of the new F 150 and the amount of effort Ford put into it  I felt compelled to check it out  Since I 146m not used to how large trucks drive  I also drove a Chevrolet and Dodge for comparison b Many  Many Choices  But which one  The new F 150 comes in five different models  base XL  work truck  low end sporty STX  midrange XLT  which will probably be most popular  high end sporty  off road ready FX4  and luxurious Lariat  Trim lines are just the beginning of the choices  Three bodies are available  regular cab  SuperCab  rear seat accessed by rear hinged half doors  and SuperCrew  larger rear seat accessed by four conventional doors  Going up one size cab will cost you about  2 500  Three bed lengths are available  5 5  6 5  and 8 feet  The 6 5 comes in both regular and Flareside styles  Going up a bed size costs  300  while the Flareside will set you back another  845 For 2004 two engines are available  both V8s  a largely carryover 231 horsepower 4 6 liter and an extensively upgraded 300 horsepower 5 4 liter  The latter  with three valves per cylinder and variable timing for higher efficiency and a broader torque curve  produces 365 foot pounds of torque at 3750 RPM  For 2005 there will be additional engines  includes a V6 and a supercharged V8  A manual transmission should also be available in later years  For now  either engine hooks up to a four speed automatic  Although this automatic is supposedly  147new 148 I would expect another before too long  as Dodge and  soon  Nissan offer five speed units Drivetrains include rear wheel drive  mechanical shift on the fly four wheel drive  and electronic shift on the fly four wheel drive  Unlike in Ford 146s large SUVs  automatically engaging all wheel drive is not available  As in other large pickups  many different axle ratios with and without limited slip are available to suit different needs  highway economy  towing  etc  Although the new truck is only available in light duty   147half ton 148 form  suitably configured it can carry up to 3 000 pounds or tow up to 9 500 The FX4 and Lariat come standard with a 40 20 40 bench like other F 150s  but as an option they offer buckets separated by a full center console that flows cleanly into the dash and mounts the shifter  a first in this class   Even the performance oriented Chevy Silverado SS has a column mounted shifter  This option is less practical  but to a car guy like myself it takes full size pickups in a whole new direction Although every possible combination of the above is not available  the range of variants is staggering and will only become more so in later years as additional powertrains are added Further complicating matters this year  the old F 150 will continue to be sold alongside the new one  Ford did this the last time the truck was redesigned  for the 1996 model year  At least this time around the aesthetic jump is not as drastic I 146m not going off road  so the faux wood trimmed  city slicker Lariat probably best fits how I would use such a vehicle  But I prefer the rugged yet sophisticated styling of the FX4  I also felt that the SuperCab with 6 5 foot standard bed represented the optimal combination of functionality and maneuverability   I suspect this configuration will be most popular with non commercial buyers  The SuperCrew is available only with the shortest bed  and the 8 foot bed is available only on the XL and XLT and makes for one ungainly 248 inch long truck when paired with the SuperCab  At 230 inches  the SuperCab with 6 5 bed is already a lot of vehicle  As luck would have it  the only F 150 I could find to drive was this configuration   Even this one might have been pre sold 151one salesman thought so  but the other was willfully ignorant of its status   Styling  The F 150 146s styling has been updated much like the Explorer 146s was for 2002 and the Expedition 146s was for 2003  Almost too prissy for a truck curves have given way to a more formal  more massive  broader shouldered look  Unlike the last time around  the new truck is not clearly a step ahead of the old one  it 146s just different  The new sheetmetal is much less striking than the   a href content 113078275716 Dodge Ram s a b   click for my review  and even less distinctive than the aero influenced old truck 146s  but to my eye it is the most refined and handsome among large pickups  It is hard to imagine it ever looking old or dated  already the fate of GM 146s current pickups  Like on Ford 146s heavy duty pickups the front side window dips down to lend the styling one brand specific detail and perhaps permit the large side mirrors to be mounted a bit lower  The largest wheels are 18s  and though no match for the cartoonish 20s available on the Ram they further enhance the truck 146s bold stance While the exterior styling is clearly evolutionary  the interior is revolutionary  I 146ve already mentioned the available full center console  In comparison  the center console in GM 146s trucks  clumsily integrated with the instrument panel  looks even more pathetic than it already did  The tall  cylindrical  chrome trimmed shift lever might be a bit too space age  and it could feel smoother  but it catches the eye and demonstrates the extent of Ford 146s desire to reinvent the pickup cabin  The click  square edged styling of the leather trimmed buckets looks very upscale  The pebbled texture of the FX4 146s black  147sport 148 leather further connotes this is one tough yet ritzy truck   Want leather in something other than black  Tan leather is available only in the Lariat  Although the XL and STX share a non tach instrument cluster  the other three trim lines have six gauge clusters that not only differ in graphics  cream faces in the Lariat  for example  but in the location of the gauges  Varying the latter can be costly  and I don 146t see the point  Some subtle differences in preferences might be involved  but I imagine any of the three gauge layouts would have been fine with pretty much everyone  So perhaps they tried too hard  and have added unnecessary cost as a result Aside from these interior features  what most impresses is the level of fit and finish in the interior  The materials might not be suitable for a Lexus  but they 146re nicer than any other Ford I 146ve been in  Fits and seams appear very precise  which is rarer than it should be in domestic vehicles  After test driving this truck and wondering why Ford doesn 146t outfit its cars this well I read a review  in  Automobile   that ventured the same question  Between the styling and the materials  the new F 150 146s interior shames those in other domestic pickups b Accommodations  The front buckets first impress with their size  They feel like thrones  Then there is the matter of design  The comparison between them and the front seats in the competition resembles that between modern furniture and a traditional American sofa  Okay  maybe not quite that large a difference  but it 146s getting there  These seats are considerably firmer than the pickup norm  such that you sit on them rather than in them  They possess side bolsters  but these are too widely spaced to serve any function for all but the widest people  I found these seats comfortable  but traditional pickup buyers might find them somehow foreign As expected in such a vehicle  visibility forward and to the sides is excellent  To the rear it 146s not so good owing to the tall  distant rear end  I would highly recommend the optional reverse sensing system  I don 146t see the point of such systems in most cars  but here I see the point  The truck I drove lacked this option  but based on similar systems in other vehicles I 146ve driven it should work well The driving position is the most carlike of the domestic trucks  The Chevrolet is similar  while the Dodge seat is mounted so high I found myself planting my left foot flat on the floor 151no need for a dead pedal  In the Ford you could almost be in a car  if one with large seats positioned well above the ground  In the Dodge you 146re clearly in a truck Given the truck 146s height off the ground  the optional tubular steps were a great help getting in and out  The Chevrolet and Dodge trucks I drove lacked such steps  though they are available either from the factory or aftermarket  and getting in and out was much harder  especially with the latter   The Chevrolet 146s seating position is the lowest of the three  Especially if you are short or have kids  you 146re going to want some form of step with any of these trucks When Chevrolet introduced fully redesigned pickups five years ago they eclipsed the competition in rear seat comfort  for the first time offering a rear seat in an extended cab with enough knee room and enough angle to the backrest to seat adults in adequate comfort  Well  the GM product is now the granddaddy of the bunch  When Dodge introduced its new truck last year  it offered an even roomier rear seat  Now it 146s Ford 146s turn to offer the best of the bunch  Unlike Ford and Chevrolet  Dodge offers only a single extended cab model with four conventional doors  Although the Ford SuperCab still uses rear hinged half doors  it contains a roomier  more comfortable rear seat than the Dodge  The SuperCrew rear seat offers another six inches of rear legroom  but unless the front seats will be most of the way back  i e  for tall people up front  the SuperCab 146s rear seat provides enough room for medium sized adults  and more than enough for children The SuperCab 146s rear doors might be rear hinged  but unlike before  and still in the GM products  they contain windows that fully retract rather than just pop out  One major innovation was missed  however  I 146ve been told that rear hinged doors can be difficult to use in parking lots  as you end up with insufficient room to move about alongside the vehicle when parked next to another vehicle with both doors open  Nissan 146s upcoming large pickup solves this problem with a rear hinged door that opens 180 degrees  The Ford 146s just opens about 90  Could be an argument for the SuperCrew 133 An optional power sliding rear window is another first with this truck  No power folding rear seat  yet  though As in all large pickups beginning with the 1993 Dodge Ram  cargo compartments within the cabin are generously sized  Ford offers an innovative track system that fits various accessories as well as storage on the ceiling  but this was replaced in the truck I drove by an optional sunroof  Yes  a sunroof in a large pickup  They must really be targeting people used to cars 133 Even regular cabs have small rear hinged doors to provide better access to an enlarged internal cargo area Unlike the Chevrolet but like the Dodge the SuperCab 146s folding rear seat is split 60 40  Unlike the Dodge  there are no nifty storage compartments beneath it  but this frees up a big more volume The new pickup beds are a couple of inches deeper than the norm  To my eye this significantly enhances their cargo volume  However  one review I 146ve read suggested this together with the Ford 146s height  GM products sit a bit lower  makes it hard to reach into the bed and grab stuff  Unfortunately  I did not check this out  but will the next time I have the chance  An innovative torsion bar makes the tailgate easier to open and close than other pickups b On the Road  The styling and interior comfort of the new F 150 suggest a better driving truck  Is this accurate The FX4 comes standard with the three valve  5 4 liter V8  In comparison  the GM 5 3 liter produces five fewer horsepower and 35 fewer foot pounds of torque  The latter seems an especially significant difference  The touted  147Hemi 148 5 7 liter in the Dodge kicks out 45 more horses  but only ten more units of torque 151so in the midrange the two engines aren 146t far apart  The Dodge also has another gear ratio to play with  How does all of this shake out  Well  even though I tested the GM engine in the Avalanche  which is heavier than the Silverado  it felt the perkiest of the three in normal despite having the weakest stats  Both the Ford and the Dodge have to be prodded more to get them to perk up  At full throttle the Dodge might well have the edge  but based on the seat of my pants the difference is too close to call  I suspect differences in mass counterbalance those in power  The truck I drove weighed about 5 700 pounds   Glass sunroofs  step bars  the FX4 146s standard skid plates  the stiffer longer frame 133such features can add serious mass  In comparison  a base GM 4WD extended cab truck weighs under 5000 pounds  though the 4WD Avalanche clocks in around 5 700  The Dodge falls between the two I also drove the Chevrolet Silverado in 345 horse SS form  It 146s quicker Bottom line  Even with the revised 5 4 and optional 3 73 axle the Ford is hardly quick  I especially expected more passing power on the highway  What the Ford V8 is is quieter and smoother than the others  The Chevrolet produces considerably more intake roar with little provocation  while the Dodge 146s Hemi produced so much mechanical noise at idle that I almost thought the salesman had grabbed the keys to a Cummins diesel by mistake   The Hemi engine will later be available in Chrysler 146s large cars  that should be interesting given its very trucky character EPA ratings are 14 18 with four wheel drive  15 19 with rear wheel drive  similar to GM 146s 15 18 and one mile per gallon better than Dodge 146s 13 17  However  word of mouth suggests that real world fuel economy is best with the GM trucks  People I know with GM trucks typically report fuel economy in the 14 15 range  those with Fords in the 11 12 range  or worse  I suspect the additional weight of the Ford trucks  which forces their engines to work harder  is to blame  Ford claims major frame and suspension improvements for better ride and handling  The frame is nine times stiffer than the old one  while the cabs are twice as stiff  The rear springs are wider  while the shocks are mounted outside the frame  The steering is rack and pinion  a first for four wheel drive trucks   The Dodge uses rack and pinion with the rear drive chassis only  But how does it all pan out In character the new F 150 resembles the current Expedition  body motions feel more precisely and tightly controlled than in the competition  and the steering is firmer and also more precise  Lean in turns feels more restrained than in the others  especially the non SS GM products   147Taut 148 comes to mind  That said  the GM products handle more responsively and intuitively  They feel somehow more natural despite their overboosted  less precise steering  The Ford in comparison feels technically superior but distant Another downside the large Fords share  a faintly jiggly ride over minor pavement imperfections   147Taut 148 has a price  Granted  I drove the F 150 in FX4 form  which includes a stiff  off road ready suspension  But the Expedition feels much the same  and the current Explorer does as well  so I suspect this jiggle is inherent in Ford 146s suspension philosophy  Throwing some mass in the back might help  I 146ve long noted in  Consumer Reports  that  unlike most cars  Ford 146s cars often ride better when heavily loaded  If this is true for the cars  it must also be true for the trucks  which are designed to carry loads  In short  Ford 146s suspension philosophy might include optimizing the ride with the vehicle heavily loaded Noise of all forms is unexpectedly low in the new Ford  This is the common finding from my test drive  refinement  refinement  refinement  Did the Blackwood come a generation too soon I did not evaluate off road performance  given that this was a test drive  I lack the skills at any rate  I would be surprised if the new FX4 did not perform well off the pavement  though  One nifty feature  the electronic throttle is more progressive in 4 low b Safety  Like the GM trucks but unlike the Dodge  four wheel anti lock brakes are standard  On the other hand  side airbags  of the curtain variety  are only available in the Dodge  Traction control and stability control are not yet available on any of these four wheel drive trucks b Pricing  As you might have noticed  I drove a truck with most of the available options  They add up  The sticker on my truck  which still lacked a few minor options  and the pricey Flareside bed  read  37 770  Go with the SuperCrew and check every box  and the sticker will easily top forty  Edmunds suggests dealers will discount the truck I drove to  35 000  Currently no rebate is available  though low interest financing is Since many features on this truck are not even available on the competition  to get a sense of relative pricing it is better to look at an SuperCab XLT 4WD with the 5 4 liter engine  automatic  electronic 4WD  limited slip differential  rear defroster  power driver 146s seat  alloy wheels  and towing package  I expect this will be a popular combination  This truck would list for  33 105  and  30 700 after the typical discount   Note  Doing without four wheel drive would cut the price by over  3 000 A similarly equipped Chevrolet Silverado LS extended cab with 5 4 liter V8 lists for  32 080 with a heavily discounted  147light duty power package 148  I suspect this package is intended to counteract Ford 146s new truck  After the typical discount and a  1 500 rebate  the cost drops to about  27 600  A similarly equipped   a href content 113078275716 Dodge Ram a b  1500 Quad Cab with 5 7 liter V8 lists for  34 500  The typical discount and a  1 000 rebate take this down to about  30 600  So about dead even with the Ford The Chevrolet is the oldest truck here  and GM has priced it to compensate  the other two are  3 000 more  quite a difference  I see lower transaction prices from Ford and Dodge in the future  but in the case of the former perhaps only after it stops selling the old F 150 in 2005  Until then  the old truck can be used to keep price sensitive buyers from defecting to GM i Update i  I ran the above numbers assuming that the Ford s electronic four wheel drive system  optional on XLT  standard on 4WD FX4 and Lariat  is a ful time system  as the salesman claimed as much  But I see no such claim in the brochure  and  Consumer Guide  states that Ford offers only a part time system in the F 150  If so  then I have overstated the price of the Chevrolet and Dodge by about  400  The new Ford just seems pricier and pricier b Last Words  The new Ford F 150 impresses with its style  fit and finish  and all around refinement  I cannot recall ever finding a standard full size pickup so appealing  The truck s major weakness is too much poundage even for its new  stronger engine  Overall  the new pickup shows what Ford can do when it pours talent and money into the development of a vehicle  But can the new F 150 recoup its large investment and relatively high manufacturing costs  Can it bring good times back to Dearborn  That remains to be seen  The Chevrolet and especially the Dodge seem very trucky after a drive in the Ford  But the new Ford is priced far above the Chevrolet  and I 146m unsure how many people will be willing to pay the premium  A few months will tell  
 Just got my Suzuki Grand Vitara 3 weeks ago  it s a scream Have almost rolled 600km  I m in Canada EH  and so far everything is EH OK Have to admit that the wife and I did a fair amount of research prior to buying since these babies go for  25K  up here in the Great White North   Our 2000 JLX  GV came in at just under  27K but our first and final choice was the GV  and we are pleased with our decision Machine is a real head turner in our neibourhood that s proliferated with RAV4 s  HONDA CRV s  a few Tribute s and ISUZU s GAS mileage is about 20mpg on the highway and around 18mpg in the city  not the best   We were told to expect this since it s new  and that it would gradually increase as we added the additional km s This is the 6th vehicle I ve owned  the first one purchased NEW  and a departure for me  my 5 previous vehicles were all Chrysler products   66 Dodge Polara  72 Plymouth Satellite Sebring   76 Chrysler Cordoba  83 Chrysler Imperial  89 Chrysler Dynasty   Interesting to note that each vehicle owned required more maintenance  more frequently  more expensive to repair  less reliable and generally more headaches as you progress from the 66 Dodge to the 89 Chrysler   Started driving when I was 19 and am now 48 I plan on fixing 2 items that bother me  the AM FM CD player has NO bottom end  a good set of speakers should do the trick and 2  the factory installed tires   Bridgestone Duelers will be replaced  so I can sleep better at night   Enough said about that Other than that  everythings fine   Had the infamous  Rotten Egg  odor problem that was resolved by switching to a different Gas brand with a lower sulphur content NOTE to potential buyer s get the dealer to throw in an owners manual  and READ IT Overseas designers engineers have funny ideas about where certain switches and knobs belong  took me a week to figure out how to have the interior lights come on when you open the drivers door  If your in the market for an SUV  have a long close look at the SUZUKI GRAND VITARA  then buy it Both my wife and I highly recommend the GV she says GV stands for Great Vehicle and she s never wrong br br  
 The Acura Interga is truly a pocket rocket  Not big  not bold  not flashy  but it can certainly hold it s own on the road  The power plant in mine is the VTec engine and it is awesome  Red lines around 8100 RPM and gets into it s main powerband between about 6500 and 7800 RPM which makes it really fun to drive  Off the line it is quick as I have chirped the tires in first  second and third gears  Also  this thing handle like it is on a rail  It is somewhat small with a low center of mass which contributes to it s exceptional handling characteristics  Just recently I broke my personal land speed record with my Acura  I don t care what Road and Track says  I know what my speedometer said  I was going from Santa Barbara to Fresno one night at about 1 30 in the morning on highway 41  Just before Kettleman city there is a stretch of road about 5 miles long with a grade of about  1 5  I got that baby up to 140 mile per hour and roughly 7750 RPM  It was awesome I ve been in sports cars before which feel like they are going to rattle apart at around 120 and this car felt as stable as can be at 140  An incredible ride in an incredible car  Only bummer was the gas mileage at 140     
 This car is the best car in this price range and drives great  It combines quality  luxury  reliability  value  safety  and power  This car is great for anyone  a kid  an adult  a parent  or a car enthusiast  It has the best reliability I have ever seen for a car in this price range  Volkswagon is my favorite car company  They keep making quality cars while keeping their prices low  When I bought my Jetta  it didn t feel at all like I was being ripped off  This car will keep most of its value in years to come  If you have the money  buy this car br br  
 There are a number of versions of the E Class from Mercedes Benz  These versions basically correspond to the size of the engine  Currently there are three versions available in the E Class  the 320  the 430  and the E 55 AMG  The 320 is equipped with a six cylinder 3 2 liter engine and is considered the base model  The next step up is a 4 3 liter V8 with added upgrades  The top model is a 5 5 hand assembled 349 horse powered V8  Unfortunately all of these models share the same core body with an upgrade here and there  I considered the body style to be old and tired  The car is shaped more like a tank than aerodynamically inspired  Also the interior is more of the same blah  It has an unimpressive counsel with oddly arranged wood trim  A few years ago I would have given glowing reviews to this car but considering the new body designs in the S Class and the C Class it is time for MB to give the E Class a new look In addition to the old look of the car it is very expensive  The base price for the 320 is about  47K  Unfortunately this price does not include basic luxury features like a sunroof or rear shade  New car buys could easily add another  6K in basic luxury features  A fully equipped and decked out version will cost at least  61K or  13K over the base price  Also please remember that this is for the 320 version  The 430 starts at  53K  
 It is going to be a sad day when my 1996 Honda Civic LX Sedan begins to die on me I chose this vehicle because I was raised on Hondas  my parents had them in my childhood  and the first car I ever drove was an  88 Accord that served me faithfully  Until I got this car  that is  My parents decided to get me a more reliable  newer vehicle as a high school graduation present  and the Honda Civic LX Sedan was on our short list My parents and I knew that this car would be a safe investment for those trips back and forth between college and my parents  house  and beyond  It wouldn t cost me a fortune in gas or maintenance  which is invaluable for college students and other people who are on a tight budget  My dad also loves Hondas because he tends to sell our cars every few years  and Hondas have low depreciation rates However  I won t let him sell my car  It is a joy to drive  It hugs curves  accelerates decently  and doesn t guzzle gas  I frequently get 35 mpg on the highway  While there is typical road noise when you get going on the highway  it s probably one of the quietest and most secure feeling vehicles in its class and price range  The steering is very accurate  I can make the smallest turning circles and fit into the tightest of parking spaces  all without getting my car nicked The acceleration can be a little sluggish because of the not so powerful engine  but if you want better acceleration and less fuel economy  you should probably check out one of the smaller Acuras  another line of cars built by Honda  it is the  high performance cousin  of the Honda Furthermore  it s attractive inside and out  with the typical Honda tastefulness  If a Honda looks tacky  it s probably due to after market additions  My body style   not too curvy  not too angular   still looks fresh and clean today  It isn t modern anymore  per se  but it doesn t scream  1996  like some domestic cars do On the interior  seating is soft  tasteful and comfortable  although the support could be a little firmer for greater comfort on long drives   Again  you would find more performance oriented seating in an Acura  Also  we ve noticed that the front seats sometimes feel like they re leaning toward the center console when you ve been on the road for awhile Controls  switches and dials are intuitive  if I let a friend drive my car  it doesn t take them very long to orient themselves  The cruise control is mounted on the steering wheel  for example  and the shifter is in the center console instead of behind the steering wheel The dashboard styling is smooth  simple  and non distracting  and the finish is slightly textured and dull to avoid glare  The climate control is very good   the air conditioner gets cold quickly  the heater warms speedily on cold days  and the defogger clears misty windows fairly well if you know the correct settings to use If you re in the market for a very reliable compact car  used or new  and you don t mind spending a little extra for quality  and low depreciation in the long run  the Honda Civic should be on your short list  
 Over the past six years I have owned three  3  used Nissan Maxima s  I have found all of them to be exceptional  You might ask why I have gone through three cars in this time period  The answer  I drive and average of 30 000 miles per year and usually only hold on to them until they have around 120 000 miles on them  I have had nothing but great luck with all the maxima s I have owned The reason I keep going back to the Maxima is simple  Reliability  Every one I have had  has had over 75 000 miles on it and I drove them to over 120 000  During that time I have not had to do anything other than routine stuff  i e  tires  brakes  oil change  I find the maxima to be the ideal for my sales job because it is a full size car that allows me to haul around all my samples as well as be roomy enough for four or five people to take out to lunch  The mileage is good  Usually 25 mpg  which is good for a full size V 6 3 0 litre engine  Also one of the best features of the Nissan Maxima is the resale value  You can shop around and find a good deal on a used maxima if you know what you are looking for and act quickly  I have been fortunate enough to get a good deal on all three of mine and drive them for a couple of years and sell them for a couple thousand less than I paid  Not bad when you figure you get 60 000 out of a car and only pay  2k  You will lose  2k as soon as you drive a new model off the lot To sum it all up  I am very pleased with the Nissan Maxima and would recommend it for anyone in the used car market  My only advice would be to get a SE or GLE model  They are a little bit sportier and come with the Bose radio system that sounds great br br  
 Let me start off by saying that ever since 1994 when Ford came out with the new SN95 body for the Mustang  I have had an 8 foot long poster of the sleek  rio red  Mustang GT on my wall  This car was the car I have always wanted  and a while ago  I was able to finally purchase one I purchased a used  black with black black grey interior  1994 Ford Mustang GT with 62k one owner miles  with the 5 0 litre engine  215 220 horses  5 speed  dual exhaust  factory option Mach 460 sound system with the two 85 watt amps in the trunk  all stock  no mods  This car was exactly the car I wanted  It had everything  The Mach 460 system sounded great  the car handled pretty well  and it had power  I was satisfied The Mach 460 sound system is an incredible system  especially for being a factory option and not some custom stereo  The only complaint I can find with the system is perhaps the CD and cassette decks  You must have both decks in working order to be able to use either of them  I never use the cassette player  but if it were to bust  I would either have to get a stock replacement for it  or an entire new CD player just to be able to have a working CD player  The reason for this is because the volume controls  along with the bass  treble  fade  etc  are all on the cassette deck  so you wouldn t be able to control any of that if the cassette deck broke  However  besides that fact  I love the system  If you do get this system  you also get two factory 85 watt amps included in the trunk  which is all that much better  So all in all  the system is great The SN95 body  which lasted from 1994 1998  making the 1994 the first of this style  is incredible  It s sleek  allows for good handling  and leaves a pretty good space for the interior  It has that famous side intake near the rear wheels  a great spoiler rear wing that nicely complements the rest of the car  and I just think the body looks amazing  It s a huge constrast to earlier Fox Body mustangs with the boxy type look to them  I myself even consider this body style to be better than the new  99 02 bodies with the false hood intake and side intakes The interior on the car was as well  the first to have the cockpit like design for the Mustangs  I really like this design  and it also allows for easy access to everything for the driver  The only complaints I can have about this are the location of the fog light switch and the one and only cup holder and it s placement  The foglight switch is right on the console between the driver side and passenger side seats  Instead of it being there  I would have suggested it be near the headlight pull switch and the rear defrost button up to the left of the stering wheel on the dash  As well  the cupholder comes out of the console lid inbetween the two passenger and driver seats  Its even somtimes a hassle to get it out  you have to flip the lid  which is held by a magnet that can sometimes be tricky to lift up  then pull up on the cupholder  and flip it out  Even then  you can barely hold a medium drink from McDonald s in there  However  many people who own mustangs and don t like this  have simply switched out the entire center console are  and replaced it with the console from a 1996 98 console  which was first to feature the two cupholders right by the emergency brake  Other than that  the rest of the interior on this Mustang is great  The seats are great  and they even come with optional lumbar support  which is nice  The only thing I don t like about the space of the car  are the rear seats  but this is almost always a common thing in sports cars  Sitting in the rear seats is bad  there is no leg room  and you often find yourself having to put your knees on either sides of the seat in front of you  but oh well  if you re looking for room and space in a car  don t look for it in sports cars The engine on this car is great  and I was extremely pleased when Ford continued on with the 5 0 legacy  which ended in the next year with the 1995 mustang  and they went to the 4 6 on the GT s in 1996  The 5 0 litre engines on the GT s gave out actually 215 horsepower  but Ford said it gave 220  Regardless  that s good amounts of power  and it s stock  The car also sounds really nice with the dual exhaust  However  the headers on the car are bad  Because of production time and costs  Ford but some dents in the headers to make them easier to install  and this descreases your possible horsepower  If you take a look under the hood of a 1994 mustang gt  look on the right side at the headers  and you ll see what I m talking about  Also  Ford has been putting in these air intake silencer  which are at the beginning of your air intake system  and are usually located by the right front fender  It s a rubber cone shaped piece that Ford used to silence the sound of the car a bit  and to keep some more of the debris out  People who are big into performance know about this  and right away they usually just yank that out of there  and it s good for a couple horses  All in all  this engine is great  and I just wish Ford would have continued with the 5 0 The stock shifter is something I have to say something about  It sucks  If you read any magazine that has an article on the stock shifter  or have driven one or talked to someone who has  they ll all tell you that the car was made with a really bad shifter  It shifts hard  and is really easy to miss third  But this is easily taken care of by simply buying a new shifter  removing the console  switching them out  and putting the console back on  then you re good to go  Simple as that So the 1994 Ford Mustang gets my approval  It s a great car  sleek and stylish body  nice engine  great stereo  and just a few minor things that need to be worked out by the new owner  I would recommend this car to anyone who knows how to handle a performance car  and is able to drive it  Don t let an in experinced driver take this car out  especially with a 5 speed  and let them think they know what their doing when the peel out  Trust me b Update b I have just recently purchased a 1994 Ford Mustang Cobra as well  so I will soon have a separate review on that car  The Cobra is considered to be the next step up from the GT  so there will be some similarites and differences to describe  thanks  
 I had been looking for a good  dependable car for some time  I was told by several people that Escorts were excellent cars  In fact  I never heard a bad things about them  So  I recently bought a 1995 Ford Escort  4 doors  hatchback  automatic  I was also told by my mechanic that Escorts are very inexpensive to repair and are normally very good cars I bought the car a few days before planning on a trip from NY to OH  Well  the trip to Ohio was the big test  and this car passed with flying colors For starters  this car is loaded and has everything   including A C  which was a very nice feature for my long trip in the middle of summer  In 2 days  I drove over 15 hours in my Escort  The seats were very roomy and comfortable  The hatchback trunk held all my stuff with plenty of room to spare  I ve never seen a trunk with so much room  Held all of my luggage with no problem whatsoever  The car would easily fit a family of four  Two adults easily fit in the front seats and two adults would even fit in the back seat  The back seats also fold down so you can fit longer things in the trunk of the car  The car has great pick up  You step on the gas and you GO  This is especially very good for getting on the highways  This car is also very fuel efficient  A 450 mile trip  one way  cost about  25 to get there  That was mostly without A C which would cost a little more to get there  but it s still great mileage  The car has dual airbags and automatic seatbelts   both which lowered my car insurance rates  not to mention just great features  There are power locks  power windows  AM FM radio and cassette  The A C takes less than a minute to get cold   it works great  I usually have to turn it off  or lower it  right after a few minutes because it gets TOO cold  When I bought this car I got a 24 000 2 year warranty  and free oil changes and inspections for 2 years  This is my third FORD car and so far my favorite yet  I consider this a very good  dependable car  I plan on having it for quite a while br br  
 Almost 40 years old now  the Mustang is still going strong  According to specs sells have reached over 150 000 units for 2002 alone  people continue to flood into showrooms to get the  best bang for their buck  The Mustang for 2002 comes in 4 models  the 2 base trim lines which feature a 190 horsepower 3 8 liter engine that is offered in either a convertible or coupe  The other 2 trim lines are performance models  known as the GT  The GT features a SOHC  4 6 liter unit  and is also offered in either a coupe or convertible   NOTE b  There is no Cobra offered this year  next year there will be a 390 horsepower  supercharged  Cobra Mustang i Driving Impressions i  Since 1999 the Mustang GT has underwent dramatic styling   performance  changes  and minor interior and chassis modifications  Most people favor these changes made by Ford  The Mustang GT no longer has a  just adequate  215 horse power as it did in 1996 1997  nor does it have 225 horse power like it had in  98  For the 2002 model year the Mustang GT now has an exciting 260 horsepower at 5 250 RPM  and 302 lb ft of torque with its modified 4 6 liter SOHC modular V8  260 horse power for a Muscle car sports car may not sound  super powerful  especially since its rival  the Camaro Z28 has 60 more horses  The 2002 GT does very well with the the 260 horses provided  The 5 speed allows the driver to get the most out of this engine  although it would be appreciated if a silky smooth 6 speed was added to the line up  The considerable power increase in the mid range after 1999 means the GT really moves  Burnouts are almost inevitable when matched with the 5 speed manual  especially when in the hands of a driver with a heavy foot  The GT is very strong off the line  and continues to be so all the way to 100 MPH   The top speed is reported to be near 150 MPH  but you won t see me driving one that fast  at least not on the street  I have only taken my friends 2002 Mustang GT Coupe  my test machine  out for a few runs by myself  and each time it s a blast  I do test drive quite a few cars  and out of all the cars under  30 000  the 2002 GT is one of the most involving to drive  and one of the fastest to boot  On the freeway the Mustang is a little louder than needed  but this is all part of the fun  The GT s dual exhaust offers a beefy note  letting other drivers know you are in a serious muscle car  The Mustang GT is very compliant on bumpy roads  especially for a performance natured car  and does quite well in slippery conditions  thanks to its genius traction control  A stiff chassis and well tuned suspension means the 2002 Mustang GT really takes to twisty roads with enthusiasm  A fairly wide track  and large 17  rims  with all season radials result in excellent stability and impressively high levels of grip  Braking is also good  My Test car came with 4 wheel discs with 4 wheel ABS  this is standard safety equipment on all 2002 Mustangs  Note  Expect to get around 26 MPG with conservative driving with the 5 speed manual  Also a 4 speed automatic transmission is optional   About the engine b  In 1996  the Mustang GT ditched the 5 0 OHV unit  and got a new engine in the form of a 4 6 liter V8 modular unit  While rated at only 215 horse power in 1996 and 1997  and 225 in 1998  the 1999 2002 Mustang GT s offer basically the same 4 6 SOHC engine  only with 260 horse power and 302 lb ft of torque  This welcomed increase in power is mainly because of higher lift  longer duration cams  bigger valves  and a revised intake system  The 2002 Mustang GT also got a revised  suspension  in 1999  namely a wider rear track  and greater suspension travel  The 1999 2002 Mustang GT s also have received revised shock absorbers and anti roll bars to improve handling  note  The base models equipped with the 3 8 liter engines do not get this treatment i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the 2002 Mustang GT is very well laid out  and very well equipped  Test car came with power everything  a thick leather wrapped steering wheel  an optional 460 watt stereo system  with a 6 disc CD changer   a 1 140 watt System is available if you want to blow your ear drums out  Some other amenities included a super cold AC  daytime running lamps  a tachometer  a theft deterrent system  and tinted glass  Ergonomics are near perfect in the 2002 GT  and so is the drivers position  The GT offers excellent visibility  easy to use controls  and superior comfort for long journeys  The Mustang GT s 2 front sport bucket seats were dressed in leather and boasted 6 way power  The seats in the Front are very comfortable and supportive  but because of the lack of leg and head room in the rear  the experience is not quite as positive  The front passenger and driver are given plenty of room however i Exterior Innovation i   Since the Mustangs Substantial makeover for 1999  this car looks aggressive and distinctive with a wider  more road hugging stance b  There really is not much difference from the look of the base models  expect some minor cosmetic treatments  some include side hood scoops  and a GT badge on the side of the car  and a  Mustang GT  badge in graved in the rear bumper  The front Headlights are flush  and very slightly  cat eyed  triple taillights continue to be part of the Mustangs theme  but they now have sharper edges like the rest of the body   Price  Warranty  and Reliability b  The 2002 Mustang starts out at around  16K for the base modeled coupes  A GT model will run in between  22 000 28 000  My test car has 8 000 miles on it  and my friend has never had to take it to the shop  but with only 8 000 miles it s kinda hard to comment on her car s reliability  The GT has always been a fairly reliable car  even in its pushrod days  the GT has offered years of reliable performance  just look at all the older GT s we see on the road  I suggest you ask around  I m guessing you will hear good news from the owners of these cars  Ford does not offer the best warranty  Ford offers a 3 year 36 000 mile bumper to bumper warranty on the GT   Final Notes i  It takes a certain type of person to appreciate the Mustang GT  if you are into high revving 4 cylinders this is definitely not your car  The 2002 GT offers excellent muscle and accommodation at an excellent price If you liked this review  you might also like to read my review on the

 I bought my 1996 Caravan to replace my 1988 Voyager which had many mechanical problems  I was told Chrysler had redesigned the transmission on the new mini vans  so I decided to buy one  What a mistake  Again  I had to replace the tranny and two axles at a cost of over  3000 during the first 60 000 miles  Then at 82 000 miles I was told the front axle had to be replaced again  From the first day I bought the car  the windshield wipers would mysteriously run then stop on its own  I never knew when it was going to happen  My family and I just thought there was a little gremlin inside the engine playing jokes on us  The van had a great comfortable ride  but i couldn t afford the repairs on it  I decided not to keep it and still feel sorry for the poor person who now owns it  I have owned three Chryslers during my 26 years of driving and have had major mechanical problems with all three of them  I will never buy another Chrysler product again and don t mind sharing my opinion with anyone     
 Due to a combination of circumstances with which I will not bore my busy audience  it was recently necessary that I make a trip from Boston  MA to Atlanta  GA and back  a journey of some 1000 odd miles each way  Due to the amount of luggage that needed to make the trip as well  flying was prohibitively expensive  and due to that same quantity of luggage none of the cars owned by the four parties involved were large enough  so the decision was made to rent a minivan  The automobile chosen was the 2001 Ford Windstar  and having now spent a total of 34  hours driving and riding in the vehicle through sun  rain and fog at all hours of the day and night  I have prepared a brief sketch detailing my thoughts  After all  I might as well have something to show for my absence from epinions  right As a passenger I must first note that I found the rear seats  which are pretty comfortable for basic sitting  a little firm  but not unpleasantly so  to be almost impossible to sleep on  Since we were taking turns with the driving and going straight through a 14 hour trip after not having slept a whole lot the night before  this distance is from CT to Atlanta we rested after the three hour trip from Boston to CT  it would have been very helpful if the drivers to be could have gotten some sleep while waiting for their shifts  but this was extremely difficult  This is partly due to the fact that the back seats are bucket seats and are placed about six inches away from the inside wall of the car normally I like to lean against the door with a pillow to sleep in a vehicle  but this was impossible in the Windstar  This may seem minor  but I considered it a serious flaw due to the situation  on the return trip we left at 9 30 pm and drove all night  so comfortable seats for sleeping would definitely have been helpful For those who do not anticipate spending a lot of time sleeping in the back seat this may not be much of an issue  but if you are ever considering renting one for a trip  as we did  I would say that this factor definitely warrants consideration as all four of us had a lot of trouble getting any rest while on the road  The front seat  which is set against the door in the usual manner  was a little better for sleeping  but it still proved hard to find a good position  The firm seats don t really yield well to any position other than sitting upright  so any sort of slouching or leaning in an attempt to nod off is not welcomed by the car I should note that the vehicle has a removable second back seat which is a bench seat we rented it without this to leave more room for the cargo  but that one may well be more comfortable for napping than the two rear bucket seats we had The front seats are easily adjustable to a wide range of angles handy since three people of varying heights were taking turns at driving and the rear seats recline pretty far back  although  not to belabor a point  this somehow did not prove helpful when it came to sleeping As a passenger in the back seat I also noticed that it swayed quite a bit in the rear  I could often feel it lurching a little from side to side due to wind  swerves  etc  but this was barely noticeable in the front seats and did not seem to affect the vehicle s handling I drove the Windstar for the most part on highways  The little city driving I did was unremarkable I mostly noticed that I was more uncomfortable with the vehicle in town because with more other cars closer to me the size of it became more noticeable and I am not used to driving a large car  but it handled smoothly and braked well  I am always interested in brakes  and since I managed not to sideswipe anyone I consider the adventure a success Out on the highway it took a little while to get up to cruising speed  probably about average pickup for a large vehicle  although I don t have much to compare it with  and lost a little speed when going up hills  but when cruising on a flat road it performed admirably  There was no noticeable difference in feel between 50 and 80 mph  and occasionally and briefly up to 95  the ride stayed smooth and the noise level  it was always a little loud  but conversation was still possible between front and back seats with a little raising of the voice  remained the same  This was sometimes a bit of a problem when I would glance down and notice that I was going 85 without meaning to  but once I learned to keep a close eye on the speedometer I could only admire the smooth way it handled high speeds  It is also equipped with cruise control  so if you like to use it this would also have solved that problem Personally I prefer to moderate speed manually  but I also prefer standard transmission  just a control freak  I guess  The Windstar  of course  is an automatic  and I can report that transmission was smooth and quiet It does take rather wide turns  and turning feels a little tricky at high speeds  but then  no matter what you re driving you should be careful around turns at 80 mph  but otherwise the handling at highway speeds was very nice  I did find that I had a tendency to drift a little to the right  although this may be my own fault rather than anything to do with the car  and there is a marked blind spot on the right side  but the car was always responsive and I never felt in danger of losing control This remained true even in pouring rain  Aside from sometimes speeding like a maniac  I am a cautious driver and tend to be wary of wet roads  but I felt firmly in control of the Windstar  after reducing speed a little to about 60 mph  even in the middle of a downpour Changing lanes was a little nerve wracking at first when moving to the left since the side of the vehicle is so long  but once you get used to it there should be no problem  Likewise  backing up was a challenge since I wasn t used to looking through such a long interior to the rear window  and parking was interesting  but these are all issues that would quickly be resolved if I had time to get really accustomed to driving a larger vehicle We had to refuel 6 times during the trip  including once to fill the tank before returning the car to the rental agency  We spent about  25 30 each time  and concluded that we got decent gas mileage for a large vehicle Cargo space  without the third row of seats  was pretty much exactly adequate for our needs  We were carrying two large cardboard boxes  five backpack sized bags of personal effects  several smaller bags of snacks and odds and ends  a video camera  a microphone case  a couple of poster tubes and some lumber  This filled up all the space with little room left over  but did not take up enough room to interfere with vision through the rear window  I would estimate that the size would be adequate for most general moving needs There are also many nice little nooks and crannies to store things elsewhere in the van  including little cubbies between both front and rear seats  a CD holder up front  a coin holder on the ceiling  etc  The cup holders in front were a little flimsy looking  but did the job  Cup holders in back were more solid and were a nice touch since we jointly consumed about 30 bottles of water and soda on the journey  We were also entertained by a little fold out mirror that allows people in the front to keep an eye on the back seats  We didn t have a whole lot of use for it  but it would probably be handy for those with lively  squirming children I should mention that this vehicle has a sliding door on each side providing access to the back seats  rather than the usual right side only door  This is a major selling point for Ford  I think  and I can report that it was indeed very handy not to have anyone having to climb over seats to get inside  We also liked the fact that the child safety lock feature  which prevents the side doors from being opened from the inside  was easy to turn off  just flip a lever on the edge of the sliding door once it s open The controls were fairly standard  lights on a dial  turn signal and windshield wipers on a lever on the steering column  emergency brake below  etc  The gear shift is on the steering column  which some people like and some don t  Personally I don t have a strong preference either way as long as it gets the job done  which this did There were no aspects of the controls that we found to be odd or hard to get used to in the short time we were driving the vehicle We had slight problems with the temperature  but only because I am always cold and everyone else in the car was always hot  Mechanically  the climate control worked just fine  There is even a separate control dial to give a different temperature for the back than the front  We didn t really do a stringent test of this function  since everyone but me was agreed on a cool temperature  but at one point we did try warming the back for those people trying to sleep while keeping the front cool to maintain alertness in the driver  and it seemed to work I obviously cannot speak to any issues that might arise as the vehicle gets to be a few years older  We had no mechanical problems  but it would have been surprising if we had  since the car was practically brand new and rented to boot  and there could be age related problems down the line that we will never know about I cannot give a recommendation on whether to buy or not buy based on my experience  but I can offer advice to anyone considering renting a vehicle to haul a bunch of stuff or several people  That advice would be  go for it if you re not planning to need sleep  but if you re going to be in it for the long haul I would seriously suggest looking for something with more comfortable seats  I would give the Windstar 4 stars in general for speediness  control  carrying capacity and gas mileage  but due to the unpleasant experience with the seats I can only give it three  Again  this may seem a small issue  but all four of us agreed that the inability to sleep in the seats was a problem on the long drive  and I personally would think twice before renting another Windstar for any extensive trip Otherwise  I have no fault to find with the vehicle  which performed admirably in the few days we had it And since I can think of no more to say  here ends my song of the rented Windstar  
 My  95 is the second Nissan pickemup I ve owned  I m a painting contractor in Colorado  amp  my trucks get worked pretty hard  Mine has also been driven to Baja twice  Phoenix  Vegas  California   amp  upstate Michigan At 117K miles it s reliable enough for me to trust on road trips  I d buy a new one in a heartbeat if I could afford one right now  One caveat  at least for the  95  The 4 cylinder is a bit of a dog on big hills  I would get a 6 cylinder if that was important to me  Other than that  its sturdy  amp  well built  amp  I ve even towed a kit car down to Phoenix in August with it  no problems br br  
 I listed the title as  quot cloaked blessings quot  for many reasons  My husband and I purchased the vehicle used  I was terrified that it was a lemon or had been a flood car because we started having all kinds of strange electrical problems  Of course the problems occured after we move far from the dealership  The clock would start to reset almost every day  some days the stereo wouldn t come on  Little strange things like that  Not to mention that my daughter could roll down the electric window in the back seat after the car had been turned off  Well  Ford was ahead of the game  Turns out that our battery was dieing  The car is smart enough to shut down completely and conserve energy enough to start the engine  This way  the driver  hopefully  will not get stuck  We changed the battery and everything was perfect  it really baffled our mechanic until he found this out  As for the windows  another feature  For passengers inside a car that was running but is now turned off  until a door opens  the windows remain fully functioning  even with the keys out of the ignition  With that knowledge  I am again loving this car  Another strange but nice feature is that the 96 XLT 4WD that we have also has both disc and drum breaks  It has all around disc breaks plus separate drum breaks for the emergency break  I have been led to understand that this is very unusual these days  These reasons in addition to the many other reasons given in positive reviews  I love my Ford Explorer and feel confident when I buckle in my children br br  
 We opted for the Sienna after checking out virtually every minivan on the market   except the Odyssey  Perhaps we would have gone for the Odyssey had ANY Honda dealer had one to test drive   one has to wonder if Honda will start cutting corners in a vehicle that is selling TOO good The first thing to notice about the Sienna is that it rides and drives like a fine sedan  The ride is comfortable  wonderfully quiet and effortless   even through the back hills of our New England hometown  The transmission is strangely smooth   switching from lower to higher gears virtually without pause  Acceleration is quick and responsive  This is starkly contrary to the Windstar  yuck  Grand Caravan or Town   Country  again   I never had an opportunity to test drive the Odyssey  The V6 210hp is more than adequate   and with a tow package  inexpensive option  the extra fan keeps the engine cool as a cucumber The dual zone climate control is standard these days on most vans  However  we re impressed with the strength of the heat system  40 degrees to a balmy 95 degrees in 3 minutes  and efficiency in both the front and back of the cargo area  No clunky on off that we had in our previous Mercury Sable Cosmetically  we love the tasteful elegance of the Sienna  No cheapo faux wood here  The Symphony edition  in gray  uses a pleasant gray weave upholstery that s soft to the touch and site  The dash board is a little too simple   a little more technology would be a welcome plus  Yet  everything is easily seen   and the blueish background non reflective readouts are a nice touch Spring for the Symphony package with the 6 way power driver seat  upgraded JBL stereo  excellent  leather wrapped steering wheel  it actually makes a difference  and other minor perks  Added together  it s worth the approx   950  invoice price  We have only one power door  dual doors only available on XLE   why    but  it s very sensitive to arms caught in the way   an important feature with a curious 3 year old In the first week of ownership   we had a close encounter with a deer who jumped in front of the van  The brakes responded perfectly   and the added skid control  440  seemed to keep us from fishtailing  I m glad to say that the deer and Sienna remained unscathed  Almost cost us a few bucks  or  at least some dough  read  doe   groan Other plusses  daytime running lights  but  I can t figure out how to shut them off at night when   say   sitting in someone s driveway  steering wheel radio controls  but  sometimes I hit the buttons accidentally  stored power for windows  pleasant  beep  when locking unlocking doors  folding AND sliding seats in ALL rows  eat THAT Mr  Grand Caravan  no center console  good be a negative for some Now the down side  the liftgate is very  I do mean very  heavy and difficult to slam shut  We almost purchased a T   C with power liftgate   I am regretting not having that one option  My wife learned that the clothing hook is not strategically located  clothing blocks the view   but  what else can be done  The rear washer sprays a straight line   like a missile   at one spot on the window  So 1 8 gets sparkling clean   the other 7 8 just has smeared and smudged dirt  The front washer is a bit better   but  a spread spectrum of cleaner would be more thoughtful  the CD holder is way out of the way   and poorly designed  ashtray is NOT an option   it s standard  boo  Careful   van has some nasty blind spots   drive carefully the first few times on the road All in all   we are VERY pleased with the Sienna  It oozes quality all over  The list of negatives hardly matter   and are really just nit picky things for which to watch out  Enjoy  
 I love my RAV4  There are lots of places to read about why the RAV4 is so wonderful  and they re all true  Check out Consumer Reports auto buying guide for 2001 or Edmunds com to name just a couple popular  trustworthy sources Actually buying a RAV4 is very difficult  You ll find many such comments on the Edmunds com Townhall discussion boards  The problem is three fold absence of standard trim levels or packages for the RAV4  Toyota s misleading brochures and online information and low RAV4 inventory at dealerships First  there are four base model RAV4s 2WD automatic  2WD manual  4WD automatic and 4WD manual  Those models don t even include air conditioning  power locks windows or any simple option  Everything is optional  In and of itself  this is not such a bad thing since in theory  you only pay for the options you want  Second  Toyota s brochures and Toyota com will help you configure the RAV4 of your dreams  That s where the dream ends  Don t expect to find what Toyota literature helps you configure acutally on a lot anywhere  Even the  standard packages  shown at Toyota com don t really exist  They re all for marketing  In reality  you cannot even order a RAV4  or any Toyota  with just the options you want  If it s not sitting on the lot or if the dealership can t trade another dealership for it  you can t have it  There is no such thing as ordering from Toyota  If you don t believe me  be sure to get your Toyota dealer to explain to you precisely what he means by  order  if he brings that up and be sure to visit discussion sites where you ll find people waiting months on an  order Third  RAV4s are in short supply  The ones that are on the lots are generally over outfitted  That might make it easier for someone who wants every option available  but if you don t want every option available  you re going to have to pay extra for options you don t want in order to get what you want the antithesis of the  in theory  support for the  everything is optional  method mentioned earlier Given these three factors  other problems arise  It s difficult to compare RAV4s to its competitors since you really have to look at each RAV4 thats available on lots near you and compare them individually against the cost and trim levels of other manufacturer s vehicles  It s not like you can say  Toyota LE is like Honda EX  and the cost difference is X  You have to do it over and over for each RAV4 you re considering  Furthermore  if you do decide upon RAV4  you have to do the same thing among RAV4s themselves comparing and pricing  It s a real pain  FYI I insisted on copies of window stickers to take home and make spreadsheets from  which I populated with information from Edmunds com  combined with the financing arrangements I had  I happen to be an information systems manager for a bank  and I have a degree in accounting  and this was a challenge for me  I wondered several times how someone without as much spreadsheet familiarity and financial savvy would manage The bottom line is that while the RAV4 is a great vehicle  you ll be so irritated at Toyota by the time its over that you ll be looking for an alternative  I did  and I loved the Honda CR V  which was even roomier and much easier to buy  In the end  I didn t want the CR V because the 2002 body style which will show up this fall will be all new  I didn t want to buy an almost out of date body style  and I couldn t find a way to wait until fall for the new CR V since my old car was a lease  Honda  btw  Believe me  I tried  
 The Xterra is built on the Frontier Pickup frame and shares its driveline with the Frontier and Pathfinder  The frame is pretty beefy  and the whole vehicle is solid  One of the most notable features is that the Xterra  atleast mine  has a great paint job which seems to fight scratches  and cleans up nicely  In addition  the side steps do a good job at protecting the side of the vehicle from careless people who swing their doors open I didn t really test drive any others  aside from having driven an Explorer and a couple Grand Cherokees on other occasions  Reason for this is that there is nothing else that has the space and feel of the Xterra for under  30K  The Xterra has a more firm ride than the others  but it also handles better and doesn t rock back and forth as much With the manual transmission  the Xterra is plenty powerful to keep up with traffic  I don t recommend the automatic  as it suffers in performance  unless you aren t a road racer anyway  The 3 3l V6 has lots of torque at low RPM s  so it cruises around town easily I ve discovered that the brakes are far better than any truck of SUV I ve driven  They are progressive  strong  and the ABS works well on varrying surfaces  thanks to a sensor which controls the pulses according to stopping force Anyway  the Xterra is not  by any stretch of the imagination  a luxury SUV  It is designed with more utility in mind  It s a vehicle which fits nicely between the mini utes that you would be afraid of breaking off road  and the luxury SUV s  which you would be afraid of getting dirty or scratched br br  
 My van must have missed Q C  None of the other reviews sound like this The van handles very nicely  although it is a little underpowered with the 4 cylinder engine especially when loaded or going through mountains  It is fine on flat terrain as long as you give yourself a sizable hole in the traffic  It will not accelerate like a sports car  It maneuvers easily and you know exactly where the rear of the van is  It is nice to drive for long distances and sitting higher increases the visibility as well as makes the leg cramping less  The interior is roomy although the third seat is not for people with long legs  I like being able to take out seats and haul around large objects on occasion  It takes two people to put the seats back in again  but one can get them out  Gas mileage is about the same as for a sedan  The front seat cup holders block the climate controls if you have cups there  but the rest is well laid out  I like the rear wiper and the second sliding door and all the room in the van to stash stuff or people There were several new vehicle glitches  The weather stripping around the doors leaked and we had wind noise and the A C hissed because of a leaking expansion valve and o ring  The parking brake stopped engaging about 30 000 miles  These were fixed at service intervals by the dealer The fold back side mirror broke off in cold weather when I adjusted it with one finger the first winter  I m not superwoman strong  It was not covered even though the van was less than a year old  Be careful as the plastic is brittle in cold weather This particular van began to have major problems once it passed 36 000 and the warranty expired  To date  it has been in the shop 16 times costing almost  5 000 and that does not include tires and oil changes  Most of the problems were with parts not even stocked in the shop  The horn stopped working and the airbag light stayed on  The clock spring was defective  Chrysler put out a recall of the clock spring about a year later  The engine head had an air bubble in the metal and had to be replaced  The defect did not show up until a thorough non dealer mechanic did an oil change and noticed that the head gasket seemed to be leaking  How that part every slipped through Q C  is beyond me  It was a very visible flaw  Chrysler did eventually reimburse us for the part  but not the labor  The repair requires disassembly of most everything under the hood  At the same time  the mechanic noticed the water pump going and replaced that  Since everything had to be drained and taken apart  I also got new transmission fluid  new coolant and new belts whether I needed them then or not The purge solenoid needed to be replaced The front caliper on the brakes got stuck shut an dug up the rotor and the rotors and brake pads had to be replaced  The rear wheel cylinders leaked brake fluid all over the shoes and drums and that had to be cleaned up and fixed  It was amazing that the brakes worked so well with all that going on at the same time last winter in snow and ice Spark plugs and wires needed to be replaced a little earlier than suggested by the service menu The service engine light has been coming on for the past three months with the code of faulty purge solenoid  The dealer replaced it 3 times  He finally got tired of seeing me and replaced the PCM  powertrain control module  which is  I think  the van s  computer  The intermittent windshield wipers quit sometimes  The dealer replaced the switch  but it still quits and now they do not know which part to throw at it next  They thought maybe it needed a  1000 part  I am still flipping the switch rather than having it repaired We contacted Chrysler about all the repairs and they said   Too bad  It s out of warranty  To keep the company from going broke  I d make a short warranty too if I thought I d have to cover so many repairs  I thought maybe mine just missed Q C  and was unusually high in repairs  a lemon  but by their response  I would guess than it happens more than you d think from  The research we did before buying this van and the mechanics we talked to told us it was supposed to be dependable  This one is dependable as repair income for the dealer I bought a new vehicle to avoid the repairs that come with an older used model and I am so disappointed  The problems are not design or engineering ones but all quality control  
 Everyone has certain expectations when they hear the name  Corvette  some positive  some negative  The name Corvette has a checkered past  First developed by GM to win the hearts of Americans who had recently been introduced to the European sports car  thanks in part to WWII service men who remembered how fun and nimble the cars were  over there  The Vettes of the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s were shadows of their former selves  barely cranking out enough horsepower to be considered sporty  let alone a serious sports car  By the late 1980s the Corvette name was starting to mean something again  thanks in no small part to the ZR 1 Now comes the C 5  the 5th generation of Corvette automobiles  It is by far the best yet  The new Corvette somehow manages to capture the sheer thrill and muscle of the old big block Sting Ray  the beauty of the split window  combined with the finesse and grace of some European exotics often costing four times the Vette s Chevrolet like price  Now add the daily drivability of a car like the current Ford Mustang and you ll begin to understand that the Corvette is really quite a bargain  Inside the Corvette  the driver s seat is a long drop if you are over 5  10  Once your butt hits the seat  there is comfort and support not normally found on cars with this much power under the hood  Surely even the most ill tempered driver can find a comfortable position  as the driver s seat has more options than a Craft Matic Adjustable bed  There is plenty of head and leg room  Hip room is a little tight if you tend to be on the bigger side  Pedals and shifter fall to hand nicely  and most secondary controls are an easy reach and lack the  plasticy  feel found on most other GM products  Although the heads up display is distracting at first  it is quite useful while negotiating curves at speed  or for passing time in rush hour traffic  some people are easy to amuse  The 12 disc CD changer also helps to pass that time  Overall the Corvette s cabin is a pleasant place to spend time  There are 4 complaints  some minor  about the Corvette s interior   1  At  43 000 or more  there should be steering wheel mounted audio controls  Even the lowly Buick Regal has that option  2  The upright part of the seats should not be manually adjusting  Power please   3  The automatic transmission version should have a dash mounted gear indicator  A simple PRNDL23 below the speedometer would do  4  The climate control is too cumbersome  and it seems virtually impossible to run cool air over the front windshield without engaging the A C compressor On the road is where the Corvette really shines  Comparisons to the Chevrolet Camaro SS or Pontiac Firebird WS6 are totally unfounded  One drive in each of those cars and the Corvette s superiority is obvious  Engineers at Chevrolet have done with the Corvette something they seem unable or unwilling to do with the divisions other cars   sports car character with an underlying level of refinement  This is where the Camaro falls far short of the Corvette  The Camaro SS is certainly fast  but also very crude  and brutish  On the playground  the Camaro is the kid who thinks he can kick everybody s butt  and acts like it  The Corvette is like the kid that CAN kick everybody s butt  yet never shows it  Alright  maybe the Vette is not that subtle  but it surely has less to prove From behind the wheel  the 2001 Corvette is nothing short of pure fun  When is the last time you drove a car that brought a smile to your face  The Corvette is just such a car  and the key is a 5 7 L  350 hp V 8 lurking beneath the fiberglass body work  Gently squeeze the gas  and you ll hit 70 mph in no time   the near perfect exhaust note only adds to the fun  Handling is excellent  With the active handling system on  the car is virtually idiot proof  Hit a tight freeway onramp at 65 mph and  nothing  the car just takes the curve with no drama  and barely a squeal from the mile wide tires  The active handling uses a combination of spark retard  and automatic  selective brake application which makes it difficult to get in serious trouble  That is really the beauty of this car  its got super car performance and handling  packaged for the average Joe  If you re a little green behind the wheel  you should never turn the active handling off  that is a sure fire way to get in over your head  The sport suspension takes away some of the comfort during highway travels  but the lack of body roll is frankly astounding  Even during hard braking and cornering  the Corvette never felt upset  or unstable  On the down side  the sport suspension lets the driver feel every ripple and crack on rough or uneven pavement  Road noise is a minor complaint  and should be better controlled for over  40 000 Overall  the 2001 Corvette coupe is a world class sports car  with a Chevrolet price tag  Storage space is adequate  power is plentiful and handling is flawless  Many have commented that the Corvette is little more than an over priced Camaro SS  This couldn t be further from the truth  The C 5 Corvette is in a class by itself  
 I don t like Fords as a matter of practice  You see   I ve had two really crummy experiences with them  My first was a 1997 Taurus  Problems started with that vehicle the first day I drove it home from the dealer and it needed a tow that afternoon  That was one of thirteen tows that vehicle needed in the 55 000 miles I put on the vehicle  and they never found the problem  The second problem is my current vehicle  the 1999 Taurus  which is in the shop as we speak due to a recall and several electrical problems that are being fixed under warranty I know  I know   I m supposed to be talking about a 2000 Ford Windstar  and that s exactly what this review is about  I m renting one  and have had one for the last week A Ford Windstar is a minivan  I must also state that I dislike minivans very much  I think  without being insulting  that they look dorky and they re made for exactly who I m not   a soccer mom The trimline on this Windstar is the SE package  It is your basic package  not a whole lot of bells and whistles are included  but it does have some nice creature comforts  The one thing I have never been able to complain about with Ford products is that they do make a rather comfortable vehicle This vehicle comes with a six cylinder 3 8 liter engine that produces 200 horsepower at 4900 rpm and 240 foot pounds of torque at 3600 rpm  It will climb hills  especially when you shut off the overdrive  By hills  I mean the Rocky Mountains of Colorado  which is where I live  It is advertised to get 18mpg in the city and 22mpg on the highway  Because I do a lot of mountain driving  I got far less gas mileage than what was advertised The transmission shifts gears smoothly  without any real jarring  In fact  I would say the transmission is as smooth as my Taurus  It is a comfortable shift of gears that is barely noticeable unless you floor the accelerator  This leads to a very smooth ride inside the van There is no flashy trim with this vehicle that would distinguish itself from any other minivan  although it does have a factory roof rack and molded bumpers  That s the extent of the fanciness outside Inside  it comes with two benches in the rear that not only fold down  but slide out of the vehicle totally  turning it from a passenger van into a cargo van  It does have an 1800 pound payload capacity  and you can fit furniture inside the cargo area with the seats removed It also has front and rear climate controls  which was a neat idea  The front passengers can control the temperature for the front of the vehicle  and the rear passengers can control the temperature back there  This is neat for children who sometimes complain that they are too hot or too cold This vehicle is also equipped with an AM FM cassette stereo  While the controls are simple to figure out  the sound is rather poor  I m not sure if that s something unique to the Ford Windstar or if that s something that s common in minivans  Either way  even hearing talk radio clearly means some heavy manipulation with the bass and treble controls Another funny thing with the stereo was that when I turn off the engine  the stereo keeps running  I can pull the key out  open the driver s door and close it and the radio still runs  This vehicle is equipped with an accessory delay  which allows you to manipulate the stereo and the windows after you ve already shut off the vehicle As an insurance adjustor  I ve never been a fan of this feature on cars  There are far too many things that can accidentally be done where a car owner can be sorry about later  Windows can inadvertently be opened and I don t trust electrical components   especially Ford electrical components   to work as advertised  Ford has a lousy history with me and their electronics The seats provide  plenty  of room inside  I certainly cannot complain about my six foot frame being cramped  I would say that a seven foot tall driver would run into a headroom problem  but legroom and headroom for me was not an issue On the other hand  the seats aren t comfortable  They are very stiff and thin for bucket seats  There is a plastic armrest that can be lifted and lowered  but it is at an unnatural position when in the lowered position  My arm feels like it is sitting far too high for comfort  I have chosen to keep the armrest up I noticed that the two passengers I took   both women   got in the passenger seat and immediately raised the armrest out of the way  so it isn t just me If you don t wear a seatbelt  the seatbelt indicator will stay lit  One thing I did notice as I was sitting at a drive through window at a McDonalds without my seatbelt on was after about twenty seconds  there is an annoying alarm that comes on telling you to buckle up  As far as I can tell  there s no way to shut up the alarm aside from buckling the seatbelt  This is a good feature for people like my dad  who for some reason refuses to buckle up The passenger bench seats are as comfortable as bench seats can be  They provide little support for the lumbar or the thighs  but then again I ve never been in a vehicle that does  While they do come out of the vehicle  they don t feel rickety and have a rather secure feeling Part of that secure feeling may come from a pain in the backside  literally  to take the seats out  It s supposed to be a simple process   you fold the seat down  tug on a hook on the floor  and the seat is supposed to slide right out  I don t claim to be the most mechanical person in the world  but it took some engineering thoughts on my end before I was successful in removing the seat from the floor The vehicle does come with power windows and power locks  The power windows are rather neat  The front windows go up and down just like in any other car  However  the back windows  pop  in and out  like van windows did  they just do it automatically  As far as I can tell  there is no way to raise or lower the rear panel window in the liftgate The liftgate does open straight up and is a single door in this model  While this is a tall vehicle  people of shorter stature  is that the politically correct term these days  should have little trouble reaching the liftgate in its open position  I have to give Ford credit for this feature There are two sliding passenger doors on this vehicle which makes for a very nice option  While I wasn t hauling around cargo or kids  I could see where this feature was a blessing  especially for cargo  It meant that with the rear seats out  you could slide the doors open and have someone pull from either direction to help load the vehicle  With the sliding doors  you can also park in very tight spaces and still gain access to the vehicle The doors do lead me to one major complaint  When I was growing up  my mother taught me that chivalry was not dead and that you open and close car doors for your women passengers  As I stated before  I had two different female passengers in this van The problem arises from the fact that some idiot at Ford chose to put the only outside key entry to this vehicle in the passenger door  While many vehicles these days have keyless entry  this particular van didn t  This meant I had two choices   I could leave the vehicle unlocked  which I am not a fan of  even if it isn t my car  or I could run over to the driver s side  unlock the door  open it to unlock all the doors and then run back to the other side of the van to open the passenger door Well  here s a newsflash  Ford  That s a lousy idea  You lose major points with me on that  even if most people would find that complaint silly Other features include power mirrors  a SecureLock anti theft system and dual air bags So  what are my recommendations  Well  I d say if you want a comfortable ride in a minivan  then the Ford Windstar is for you  If you want a comfortable minivan  you may want to look elsewhere  I m pretty annoyed with the idea that there s no passenger door entry lock  I don t like the accessory delay feature  and I don t like the strangely placed armrests for the front seats I m going to be generous and give the Windstar three stars out of a possible five  For me  that s a good rating on a Ford  For a vehicle in general  that s a mediocre rating overall br br  
 This vehicle has a sporty appearance as most people can tell  By looking at it you can feel yourself zooming down the road in this blast from the past  I was skeptical in purchasing this vehicle because of its troubled past with gas tank problems  Often seen as a car for teenagers who want to outsport their peers in a drag race  But i was surprised when I drove the vehicle for the first time and its comfyness and luxurious amenities overwhelmed the sporty feel that one can get when sitting in the driver s seat  Then you hit the interstate and you can tell why this is  quot America s Sports Car quot  The gear shift has a sporty feel and it moves easily as you shift from 4th to 5th gear  The rev of the engine proves its power that this vehicle contains  This vehicle is full of surprises and is great for adults of all ages  Since the purchase of my  99 Mustang i have seen many people driving this vehicle and not many frowns in those cars  This is also a good car for anyone of any age because it is affordable  The standard model has such amenities like CD player  power windows  power locks  and extra power adapter for car phone  Other extras include spoiler  fog lights and a sport package including alloy wheels  The key fobs that come with the car include door lock and unlock commands  a panic button and a trunk eject button  The one irritating problem that i have found with this car is that it s cup holders and not placed in an appropriate area  The cup holder that holds smaller cup sizes gets in the way of the gear shift  which creates a large problem for me  someone who spends most of his time eating in his car  Which brings up another positive aspect of the new mustang  A few months after my purchase I spilled a 32 oz  soda in the passenger seat  I started to get upset but i grabbed the large amount of napkins in my car that i had  and the soda was soaked up without leaving a stain  The scotch guard really worked  The gas mileage is mediocre traveling in town all day you may find yourself filling up every few days  but one weekend trip 100 miles away can last a long time  Mileage during travel for daily activities  between fill ups are about 260 miles  but on the highway it may take 300 miles before you have to fill up again br br  
 I bought a used Audi A6 6 months ago form a VW AUDI dealership  Here is how it went I was considering buying either a new 4 cylinder Passat for my wife or a used more luxuarious and powerful car such as a BMW 528  Lexus etc I drive a Eddie Bauer Expedition and my wife had a 98 Mustang  Space is at the premium in that car  We are becoming parents for the second time so  So here we were on my way to VW dealership to test drive a new VW Passat  The car is new  smells new and drive good but I was not impressed by the ride at all  I expected too much from that car  a good car nonetheless  It lacked leg room  real luxuary  and my wife was not as excited about it after driving it  So we were about to leave the place when we walked through the Used car lot We stop by a couple of Used Audis  96 to 98  They looked great even though they were used  Both interiors and exteriors are in great condition  the quality is outstanding  These cars are made to last and they still look great  The Audi A6 caught our eyes more than the A4 because of the size in spite of the more sporty look of the A4  Consider that versus the BMW Series 3  My wife thought it was a great car and asked for the keys  We sat in it and fell in love  Why  in a few words  Quality  luxuary  loaded with useful options  feeling of safety  comfort  prestige  We immediately took it for a spin  The vehicle kept up to our expectations  The silence added to the comfort made us feel very good about driving this car  we felt safe  The Automatic leather seats adjust in many posiitons to make any person feel comfy  I am 6 2 quot  and 230 lbs  my wfe is 5 8 quot  and both of us just felt great  The steering wheel can be adjusted from front to back  and up down  a big plus  Anybody can find the prefect driving position  Leg room is excelent  better than the BMW series 5 in the front and back WE just had to ahve this car  At that point  I had shopped around for new Passats  used cars uncluding BMWs  Let me tell you  when we saw what we could get that Audi for  we just bought it  We saved a few thousands dollars versus the BMW  and got a BETTER car  no doubt about it  Here the key word is value  But you still get a high quality luxuary car let me tell you more about our experience with this A6  drive it and let the Automatic Climate Control take charge of the temprature  just tell it what you want and it ll OBEY  Should you like to play with the buttons  just switch to manual  Other fetures are an automatic sunroof  a 6 speaker stereo  power windows  amp  seats  amp  doors remote entry  valet key  mirror defrost  windshield integrated antenna  phone ready  in dash computer  alloy wheels  and more  By the way  the driver s seat can keep 4 positions in memory  so you don t have to spend 10 minutes finding your pefect seating position after your spouse took the car for a ride  and believe me  she or he will  Both seats and mirrors adjust back to your posiiton when you open the door with your remote  My wife drove the cra home fomr the dealership  two days after  I was driving the Audi  and kept driving it everyday  I handed the keys of my 98 Expedition to my wife and we switched  That is ho much I like the Audi  I gave up my long dsired Expedition which I could not live without a few days before  but let s go back to the Audi A6 This car is equipped with 2 8l V6 combined with a great and very responsive automatic transmission that adjust to your type of driving  The engine is very smooth and quiet  He will give you a lot of pleasure driving hundreds of miles toward you favorite vacation spot  The car could use a little more power and torque but nothing bad  It is after all a luxuary sedan made for driving long distances safely and comfortably with up to 4 passangers  It ll still take you up to 130 miles per hour in spite of the speed regulator  remember Speed is limited and kills everyday  My car can got 130 mph  that does not mean I drive at that speed I can t really think of anything negative to say  Audi is one of the best car makers in the world and sell cars that can beat BMWs  MErcedez  or Lexus for a few thousand dollars less  A piece of advice  Audis are usually very well taken care of  and stay  quot IN quot  after the years thanks to their traditional yet attractive design  so look for a USED one  They have low miles  are well built  and look great after the years Finally  if you can afford the extra investment  go for the Quattro version  They stick to the road  During the winter  you will outrun SUVS  and save on gas  Shop around and compare with the BMWS which are overrated AND OVERPRICED  You might just become a AUDI lover br br  
 Confession  I am a former member of the  I hate SUV  club  But  having three large dogs  a seven year old  a 19 foot boat that I trailer  a wife who does arts and crafts shows  as well as living in New Hampshire  I had to revoke my membership and take the plunge for what made sense   an SUV  I had driven an older 4 door Explorer and a 2000 Blazer  Both seemed cushy  had roll and lean when cornering and lacked any type of road confidence  I test drove the 01 Sport and was very impressed  The 01 Sport  it has more than adequate power  There are no rattles  which my 95 Taurus wagon specialized in  The vehicle seems solidly built  I love being so high up  Also  the vehicle drives with confidence  steering is responsive and it corners better than any truck I have been in  no roll or lean   Beware of overconfidence  The sound system is the best I have ever had in a vehicle  You do feel every bump on the road  and be careful of taking a corner above 45 where there are noticeable bumps in the road  But remember  this is a Truck  not a car  The ride is quite and on a flat surface  very comfortable  as are the FRONT seats  Mileage is around 19 all round  but this is a big 4 0 engine and not all that bad for its class  Oh yes  towing  I can t tell you how many times I could not haul my boat out due to low tides   Yes  I previously towed with a Taurus Wagon  which probably hastened its premature death  This truck is an awesome tower  It does not cease to amaze me how well this truck tows a 3000 pound rig  There is no strain on this truck at all  I am sure this 4 wheel drive monster will be great in the snow and off road  if you do that thing  I paid  16 900 for this 01 truck with 13k on it from a dealer  This may be the best vehicle value out there for my needs   haul the family  boat  art  dogs and family without mortgaging the ranch  As for the back seats  stop winning  you bargained for a 2 door and that is what you got  saving you a couple of thousand in the process and giving you a much better looking vehicle than the 4 door as well as adding a few miles per gallon  
 My mom decide that her Ford Mustang was just the completely wrong type of car for her  so she decide to buy an SUV  After some research  she took an approach towards the 2000 Nissan Xterra  I went along with her to the dealer  The salesmen were rather nice  and less pushy than others that I have met  The dealer price on the Xterra was around  28 000  My mom decide that she would trade her Mustang and pay  18 000 cash for the difference  The dealers didn t like the idea at first  but after some haggling  they agreed on it  The Xterra is great  It feels like a ride on a magic carpet because it is so smooth  The seats are comfortable and the interior looks great  From the passenger s point of view  the stadium seating is a brilliant idea  While sitting in the back seats  you can see just as much as if you were riding shotgun  Not only is the interior nice looking  but the outside appearance is very pleasing to the eye  The equipment storage rack on the roof ads a nice touch  The only thing that could possibly fend away a possible customer would be the relatively low gas mileage for a 6 cylindar vehicle 15MPG  We haven t had any problems with it yet  and we do not look forward to it  I would definently recommend the 2000 Nissan Xterra to anyone in the market for SUVs br br  
 This vehicle is perfect for me  as it is my first sport utility vehicle purchase  It is kind of small and has plenty of power  which should be a plus for anyone going from a sports car to a Cherokee  This Jeep has done superb off road  It has been on a Jeep Jamboree in Kentucky and survived a trail rated  quot 8 quot  with no problems  This Jeep Cherokee Country was the nicest Cherokee you could buy in 1995  It came with remote keyless entry  woodgrain trim on the dash and doors  two tone paint  and power everything  There are only a couple of gripes I have about my Cherokee  One is the placement of the factory cupholder attachment  Front seat passengers always knock it off  Second is the loudness inside the vehicle at 60 mph and above  Otherwise  this is the best vehicle I have ever owned br br  
 I purchased this vehicle for it s excellent safety record and dependable performance history  and I ve never regretted the decision  The E320 has exceeded my expectations and delivered the quality performance I expected to be associated with the name  quot Mercedes Benz quot  I will never look back because I love and care for my family and I ll never get a second chance to ensure their safety  They will be operating this automobile and I intend to keep an  quot E Class quot  in my garage as a primary automobile because  I know they need to know  that I care  My repairs were handled quickly and resulted in minimal down time   while I waited so I never lost business     
 First  I didn t buy this vehicle   I rented it  If you ask me  anyone who s serious about buying a vehicle should rent it first  You get to drive it for a couple of days without some obnoxious salesperson hanging on your shoulder  and you also get to see what kind of shape the vehicle will be in after a few thousand miles of road use  Most renters treat the vehicles pretty shabbily  but the rental companies actually take pretty good care of them   very regular maintenance  cleanup after every use  and the like  So  here s my take on the  99 Windstar after three days and 360 miles of driving I m not a fan of Detroit iron   the three vehicles at my house are all Japanese American  So I always compare quality  ride  and the like to my Honda and my two Toyota pickups  Here s the lowdown on the Windstar Quality  the vehicle I drove had 16K miles on it  but seemed to be in pretty good shape  There were some squeaks and rattles coming from that left hand sliding door  and an annoying whistle from somewhere in the right front at highway speeds  I never did figure where that came from  Unlike my three at home  a lot of the interior plastic parts seemed to be pretty cheesy  One of the cute little ceiling compartments  a very nice idea  by the way  had been stripped of its innards  There was a piece broken out of the dashboard cup holders  and the interior door handle mounts rocked in their mounts  Overall  the quality seemed to be slightly above the Detroit cars I ve been driving  but not up to the standards of the Japanese imports  There was a little more road noise than I expected  but it was a pretty quiet ride Handling  Personally  I think Detroit s emphasis on a smooth ride leads to vehicles that wallow on the road like pigs in a mudhole  This one was no better than average  nowhere near as bad as a Jeep Cherokee  though  I drove it for 60 miles in a very heavy rainstorm  and it held the road very well  but on dry pavement it had a tendency to drift in the ruts  Comfort  Well  that s what Detroit s always aiming for  QE2 level comfort  I didn t have any rear end fatigue after a three hour drive  so I guess they succeeded  I had a little trouble adjusting the steering wheel to a suitable angle  though  and I m of very average size Design features  I liked the two sided sliding doors   I just hope the frame s stiffened enough to stand up to a rough ride  They had cute little motor driven tiltouts on the rear  also nice   no exterior ventilation in the center at all  though  I found the location of the parking brake annoying   I haven t seen a floor mounted brake between the seats in a very long time  They ve put together a few other interesting features   one of them is the chime that rings after a turn signal has been on for over a preset time  a minute  I d guess  That s nice  but where I live  Austin  TX  you re very likely to sit for twice that long at a stop light waiting to turn  so that darned chime would go off pretty frequently  Miscellany  I had a flat  not the van s fault  and had to put on one of those truly idiotic compact spares  It s mounted under the frame  so  since it was raining  was very wet and dirty  Them s the breaks  though  Besides not having a real tire  though  the worst thing was the lousy scissors jack  Actually  it was the integrated jack handle and lug wrench  The jack handle kept slipping off the driver nut on the jack  enough that I was cursing the memory of Henry by the time I finished changing the flat  That needs some attention  especially on a  26000 minivan  Oh and one last point   why is there no key lock on the passenger side  This vehicle didn t have a keyless remote  so whenever I wanted to get in the curbside door  I had to walk around to the driver s side to unlock things first  That s a dangerous  and therefore stupid  design So  if you re dead set on buying American  not always  my  first choice  this one looks like a good candidate  My sister s family had a Ford Aerostar for years  and they got good value from it  My experience with Chrysler minis has been a lot less positive  so I d pass on those guys if I were you br br  
 I have sold quite a few different makes and models of vehicles  Anything from Ford  Lincoln  Mercury  to Honda  GM  Chrysler  and Toyota  It has been my experience that out of all the different customers I ve had  and the different makes they ve bought  the customers that drove away with the new or used Camry were the happiest  I have yet to receive a complaint from someone who owns one While I sold for Ford  I would constantly see my former customers in our Service shop  not for oil changes  but for major repairs  This really isn t a problem if you still have a warrenty  but for those who don t it can get quite expensive  Camrys in general are extremely reliable  and efficient  I no longer sell cars for a living  so this really isn t a biased opinion  I run an internet business now  and even in talking in passing to my internet customers  they agree that Toyota products exceed all others  Camrys also hold their resale value better that any other vehicle on the market  This helps keep you from getting  quot Up side down quot  which is a position that noone likes to be in I myself own a camry   older model and it has been the best vehicle that I ve owned  I bought it right after the motor blew on my 96 Dodge Intrepid  that only had 60K miles on it  My advice  by a camry  not a dodge br br  
 Back for more  Ok here is the nits and grits  The V70 AWD is a totally different car than its predecessor  The platform is based on the S80  as will be the replacement for the S70 but they are not going to call it the S70  it will be the S60  The biggest differences moving forward appear to be a more civil ride  a more rigid body  quieter engine  and more cargo and passenger area  Volvo has redesigned their turbo five cylinder engines to reduce some of the weight and allow it to run more efficiently  but this car is actually heavier than the S80 by 100 pounds and has a smaller engine  Fuel economy is rated at 22 highway mpg  On the road this car behaves more an SUV  and sounds like it as well with the  quot Scorpion quot  LT Pirelli  That is not to say that it is bad but it isn t quite what I would expect  There is virtually no noticeable torque steer as there really is not enough thrust to propel you to 60 in mid single digits  I drove this car exclusively without cargo  so I would imagine that adding weight could affect the propulsion  but would no doubt improve the ride  It was hard not to notice the buffeting effects of the winds as well as the noise created by the wind and I might mention that the tires were also noisier so I turned up the radio and that was excellent  big improvement over their previous XC model The transmission is essentially the same as the previous model with the  quot geartronic quot  addition  What the geartronic does is to allow the driver to manually select shift points but where this gets sticky is when you are in geartronic mode the driver has to downshift as well  In the T6 S80s with geartronic we saw some transmission failures from people waiting too long to down shift causing clutch failure   If I sound leary I am getting through  Driving the car in geartronic mode may lead so a shorter life expectancy of the transmission  The cars that I have driven shifted smoothly in geartronic mode but when in  quot D quot  and pushed hard their seems to be some gulps and gasps before finally deciding to get going and the shift between gears under acceleration seemed harsh Transmission leads us to differential  drive shafts  and final drive and this also has been redesigned  as has the viscous coupler  The gearing is structured to create less force against the transmission and drive axles netting the driver a smoother ride  and this is good  The viscous coupler is now wider and shorter with a claimed better distribution of power and less clutch wear  The tires are also up from 15 quot  to a 16 quot  and this is a tire designed for a light truck  Pirelli Scorpion  Volvo retails this tire for around 230 00 but you can get this same tire at www tirerack com and they can sell it to you for around  85 00 a copy with shipping  This is a big plus  The tires used for the previous XC models did not stand up well to the extra friction caused by the AWD system   See my review on the Continental CH95 The promotional material points out this vehicle s aerodynamic improvements   30cd  so now you can drive a sculpted brick  But freally  this is not a bad exterior design  if you take away the big plastic  last minute looking  add ons  Incorporated into both front and rear bumpers are beefier sections that are somewhat reminiscent of a tug boat  but if you look closely you will see that this is color matched plastic which can save thousands at the body shop in the event of scrapes and bruises and it should retain its shape better than the previous models bumper coverings  Dings and bruises can be removed by careful use of a heat gun  Visually  the car from the frontal view looks like it is ready for the Paris Dakar rally but the rest of the vehicle says  quot we can finish this later quot  On the underside the car has not skid plating and in the rear suspension where there used to be alloy cast suspension arms there are Steel stamped pieces  which is less expensive and less durable than the former cast alloy set up   cost reduction Here is a big plus right from Sweden  the interior is made of 85  recyclable materials  so stop by your nearby recycler soon  Apparently this is a law now  The trim is friendly inside but I can t help but think that the metal bar in the center console says   quot handcuffs attach here quot  The seats are roomy and comfortable and even the biggest of drivers  yes you too   quot Big Bertha quot  will have room to stretch   quot Big Bertha quot  is a golf club that is a designated driver  One nice feature for those of us who let things ride around on the dash is that the defroster ports have grills  like speaker covers  over them so no more lost tickets or favorite pens Owners of older 850 amp  S V70 models could turn their own daytime running lights off now it has to be done by people like me who send satellite messages off to some unknown region of the galaxy  After a light year or two  when the new software comes back you start getting annoying spam in the message center of your dash from MSN  This is because we use a windows NT platform   Ok I couldn t resist Oh I think you will love this  it is healthier to drive due to the radiator having a special coating on it which acts as a catalytic converter  The ozone that is out there is converted to oxygen so the car and occupants get cleaner air  And this is not all the car has an interior air quality monitoring system  available as an option  SRS system has a dual stage air bag for both driver and passenger which is driven by two igniters and is deployed based on the severity of the crash Here is what is really hairy  all the cars electronics are linked by a network and when these systems were first introduced it was a comedy of errors  If you have a newer Volvo already you have no doubt experienced some network problems  These systems are software driven and are not friendly to plug and play devices like even phones  The few that we have delivered have all been back for minor problems but a car costing this kind of change should be a finished product  I can not stress enough the importance of bringing this car to your dealer for any upgrades or accessories  but that does not include handbags  go ahead and change those any time you like br br  
 This is my 2nd GT and have been a Stang fanatic since childhood  so I m familiar with the car  I recently purchased a 1998 Mustang GT with 33 000 miles to replace my 95 that I regretfully sold  The car has Ford s 4 6 litre modular engine instead of the old pushrod 5 0  The engine is a lot quieter than what you would expect from a  musclecar  Also  it redlines to 6000 rpm instead of 5500 like the 5 0  The car has a more of an import feel to it because of it s smooth revving 4 6  which makes for a very comfortable everyday car  The transmission has also been changed  5 speed  from the old T 5 to the T 45  What that means is that is shifts a lot smoother than the 95 and earlier cars  I know that a lot of readers aren t into engine and transmission numbers  but I am trying to explain why this is a much better car so I am writing what I KNOW to be factual and why  Naturally  it isn t a family car so the leg and hip room leave a little to be desired if you are over 6 1  The back seat will accomodate two small children but nothing more  The car has a 15 4 gal  fuel tank and gets 18 mpg city and 25 mpg hwy  This averages out per tank to 277 2 miles per tank city and 385 0 miles per tank highway  I drive one daily and these figures are close depending on your elevation and how heavy your foot is   LOL  even an opinion needs some humor  I don t know the actual square footage for the trunk but it is of moderate size for this type of car  especially with the rear seats folded down  This is my second GT and dependabilty as been nothing short of perfect  The Mach 460 stereo is superb for a factory system  so if you get tired of changing gears  it will rock  Overall  with my past with this car  looks like it will be in my garage for a while  
 I have a large family  myself  my wife  and six children  and we use the car often  Everybody is comfortable and happy in the car although i regret not buying the DVD system and the leather trim  Little ones need to be in the back  the 3rd row seat definitely was not intended for teens or adults but could be utilized in a pinch  When I test drove the car I brought my 5 7  sister in law and my 6 3  cousin  after convincing them to try out the 3rd row for a few minutes  cousin said he was pretty squished  sister in law said   it was fine  They did however find the 2nd row extremely comfortable  There is ample cargo room even with every seat taken  but more than 2 suitcases will be roof bound  The grocery hooks have proven to be quite a useful little accessory  The middle console is unbelievably large  cup holders are everywhere  and the storage space throughout the car is ridiculously good  I am absolutely in love with the steering wheel stereo controls  At night the dashboard is brilliantly lit and reminds me of an airplane cockpit  hence the name PILOT  The car is only 188  in length and every time i squeeze into what i thought was a tight parking spot  I am pleasantly surprised to find one foot of room on either end  Engine noise  outside city noise  and highway travel noise is virtually non existent  The ride is smooth  the acceleration is great  the car handles unbelievably  thank the wide wheel base for that  and the visibility is so good you rarely have to turn your head to see whats going on around you  I had to hit the brakes hard on one occasion and they responded beautifully  
 My brother and I have a 93 Toyota pickup  Aside from an old clunker  it is the first car we have had  This standard transmission vehicle is a great choice for the college student  It has a lot of foot room in the front and it even has enough room behind the seats to carry two skinny people  It gets anywhere from 23 30 miles per gallon on the highway  and around 20 in town  We bought this truck with 4 000 miles on it  and we have put about five thousand more on since we ve had it  We had to replace the clutch once  but I don t know if this has to do with the car s design or manual errors  Basically this truck has been an efficient  mostly reliable  and relatively unexpensive tool for us  The best part is that it is a truck that is like a car  We have a nice comfortable driving vehicle and a good way to haul all of our junk back and forth between home and college br br  
  Preamble  It was eight weeks ago that I got the call at approximately 1 30 p m   Hi  well  I ve had an accident and their towing my car right now i  I was in new hire orientation so it was probably a good thing that I let it go to voicemail  So not only had I started a new job  but we just got me a new vehicle   my Honda CRV  Stress  my friends Our  Toyota Corolla  ended up being totalled by the insurance company so I had to go on the hunt for a new car  Why me if this is my husband s car  Because  I am the bargain hunter  the negotiator  He told me what he liked  and I did lots of research  hunted it down  and negotiated the heck out of it b What Led Me To Toyota b Initially  I looked at every other model of car before even considering something from Toyota  Why  I wanted to see if anything exciting had come round in the car market since I last purchased our Toyota Corolla  1998  I checked out cars from Kia  Saturn  Ford  Mitsubishi  Mazda  Suzuki  and Honda  With the exception of Honda  I felt myself comparing every other make and model to that of a Toyota car You see  our experience with our Corolla was fantastic  It was an extremely reliable family car that got great mileage and had just enough bells and whistles on it to make my husband happy  His only complaint is that he wanted something just a tad bit bigger The Honda Accord scored major points with me because 1  I am a honda lover and 2  Honda has a great reputation with their vehicles  As I held that thought in the back of my head  I paid a visit to NADA Guides com to check out info on the Toyota Camry  What I discovered is that the Toyota Camry came with a lot of  basic  stuff that Honda seemed to make optional  That all translates into   I have no problem spending the extra money on stuff if there s a reason for it While my local car dealership was closed  I snuck on over and took a look at their remaining 2002 Camry inventory  There weren t many left in the month of September as they were gearing up for the 2003 releases b Impressions of the 2002 Toyota Camry  The outside of the Toyota Camry looks plain  but in a non boxy  non Ford like way  can you tell I hate Ford vehicles  I liked the roundness of the front of the car and the shading of the color  in this case it was sand  against the different car parts  The car didn t look like it was designed by radicals and it didn t look like it was designed by a bunch of old folks  Just a middle of the road designed I knew my husband would like that A couple of days later  I went back and asked to test drive one I was thoroughly impressed   which is something difficult for any one or anything to do  First  the entire dash was up higher than what I usually see in mid sized passenger cars  As a tall person  I didn t have to lean as much to find the controls I need to mess with   stereo  air heat  defroster  etc Second  the seats were so comfortable  I don t mean adequate comfortable but  comfortable  comfortable  No  this wasn t leather  just plain fabric  It was incredibly soft  but durable  It just seemed to hug my big fat bottom in a nice way  Third  the amount of leg and head space in the front and back for non drivers was incredibly roomy  I know the car sales dude probably thought that I was smoking something when I got out of the parked car and sat in each area  I wanted to see how I would feel sitting somewhere else besides the driver s seat  I m 5 9  and I felt comfortable sitting in all four positions  Yes  they tell you that this car seats five  but no way will I be transporting five people for hours at a time  The trunk area was larger than I anticipated  For additional room  the seats in the back could be pushed down The most confusing thing of this Toyota Camry was the keyless entry  If you wanted to open the driver s side door  no problem  You click once  To open the other doors  you have to do three clicks  It s one  pause  and then two  three  Took me awhile to train my husband on that   Opening the trunk with the keyless entry is something different too  Instead of just clicking on the button  you have to hold it down for a few seconds When I test drove the Toyota Camry I was amazed at how quiet it was   Purchasing  Being the skilled negotiator that I am  I did my research on Nada Guides  com before I approached the dealership about a particular 2002 Toyota Camry  I knew what it was worth  I knew that I had great credit  I knew that September was the time of the year that they were trying to dump their 2002 inventory I m relieved to tell you that my interaction with this dealership was as close to hassle free as you can get  For those of you in the Indianapolis area   it s Butler Toyota  Every one was extremely nice and they didn t try to sell me all of these extras that I didn t want in the first place I was able to get  3000 knocked off of the price of the car AND I was able to take advantage of their 1 9  financing for three years  That s a great deal b The Last Two Months b Have been wonderful with our Toyota Camry  We ve taken a couple of two hour trips  hittin  the highway  and as a passenger  I love how transparent the drive is  The

 I can t think of one bad thing to say about my Honda Accord  I purchased this car in 1993 and except for tune ups  oil changes and tires the car still runs great  My car has 100000 miles on it and still has the original battery and most everything else  It has never broken down or not started right up  even on the coldest day  The heat works great as does the A C  The amount of money you save on gas alone is worth the price of the car  I plan on keeping this car for many more years and strongly suggest that you lok at an Accord if you are looking for a mid size car br br  
 When picking out my first car  I had a lot of factors I considered  First  I wanted a car that was fun to drive and attractive  I also needed a reliable that was under  15 000  At first  I didn t realize that I could afford a 2001 Mustang  I found a great deal  and purchased my red Mustang  It was once a rental car  and it has 15 800 miles  There are three types of Mustangs  The 194 horsepower V6  the GT V8  and the high performance Cobra  I purchased the V6 with the Deluxe package   ABS  traction control  power seat  spoiler  CD I ve owned the car for about 7 months  and I haven t encountered a problem yet  The car is very fun to drive  When driving around town  the car quickly accelerates and passing is very easy  However  all this power means below average fuel economy  I ve been averaging 18 miles per gallon  The steering communicates lots of road feel  and the car handles well  The car has the firm ride of a sports car  and is relatively quiet  The brakes are exceptional Inside  the Mustang is well finished  The cabin has a high quality feel for the price  All the controls are within reach and very well designed  and the cup holders are of the best in any car I ve seen  The sound system provides great quality  even with the base system  One weakness with the car is the lack of rear seat room  and the small trunk  However  most people in the sports car market don t have a spacious rear seat on the top of their priority list Overall  the Mustang is an excellent car  A sports car should be fast  attractive  and fun  The Mustang has all these qualities and then some  which is why it has been one of America s most popular sports cars for almost 40 years  
  Captured by the styling b  I have to admit  we were captured by the appearance of the 2001 GT Convertible  As teenagers in the early 70 s  the stying is obviously a through back to that era  We love looks b Strong V8 b  Although I wouldn t want to race a 325 h p  Camero SS  the 260 h p  V 8 has an amazing amount of power  Ford must have also done their homework in producing the exhaust note of this engine  It has a beautiful  beefy sound under acceleration  but is quiet at steady speeds   Small but comfortable on the inside b  I am 6 1  and 230 lbs  but feel very much at home in the cockpit of the Mustang  One caveat though  if you opt for standard interior instead of the premium  the seats are much less comfortable  a least for a guy my size  Make sure to test both before deciding b Good fit and finish b  I have read less then favorable remarks about the fit and finish on the Mustang  However  I am very pleased  We own both a new style Camero and the Mustang  The Mustang seems to have more durable components in the cab then our Camero  Time will tell as we have only had the Mustang since June of 2001   Relatively poor gas mileage b  To date  I have only one minor complaint about the car it is thirsty  We average 16 miles to gallon in town  I guess we should have expected this  but I actually thought it might be closer to 20

study about the vehicle  you attend auto shows and then you check out the vehicle at your local auto dealership  In my case  January 28  1985 was the day I drove off the dealership s lot in my brand

Goodyear Gatorback  Acceleration  0 60 mph   6 4 seconds B THE BACKGROUND  I just graduated college very poor and working at a major retail store earning  12 000 per year  At the time  the Chevrolet Camaro IROC Z28  International Race of Champions  and the Mustang GT were fierce competitors  I test drove the Camaro IROC Z28 and loved the power generated by the Chevrolet V8 engine but I could not afford the hefty  16 000 price tag Working 10 hour days on non school days  I saved enough for the down payment and took out an auto loan for the difference B KING OF THE HILL  If you are familiar with Southern California  you know where the infamous Mulholland Drive is located  Mulholland Drive is a winding road up in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains  It overlooks the San Fernando Valley and is very famous for street racers  Singers Jan and Dean wrote a poignant song about Mulholland called  Deadman Curve  where hundreds of teenagers lost control and sent their hot rods over the cliff  Some lost their lives  As a teenager  I hung out near Coldwater Canyon and Mulholland Drive watching street racers race their cars against each other  The fun part of it was watching the Los Angeles Police Department helicopter air support and cruisers pounce on the racers  The racers would scatter like cockroaches when light was shined upon them I ran about a dozen races and lost two because I wasn t quick enough shifting gears  I quit racing when I saw my auto insurance sky rocket   THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL MUSTANG FACTS  The  California Highway Patrol  is known world wide as the elite of police agencies  It was made even more famous by the television series  CHiP s  Motor vehicles is the way of life for the state of California and with so many open highways  it is a no brainer that people will step on the pedal when given the chance  In 1980  the California Highway Patrol began testing the use of the Ford Mustang Ghia as a pursuit vehicle  The Ford Mustang Ghia was chosen over the Chevrolet Camaro because of its ground clearance and Ford s design crew who configured the Mustang to meet stringent California Highway Patrol standards  The California Highway Patrol Mustang Ghia had a 350 CID  cubic inch displacement  oil cooled engine with 260 bHp and a modified suspension to handle high speed maneuvering  This configuration was only available to law enforcement agencies  As the popularity of the pursuit class Mustangs grew  many state troopers and highway patrols began using them in the same manner as the California Highway Patrol   STEVE S CRITIQUE OF THE FORD MUSTANG GT  The Ford Mustang GT was a very fun car to drive  Acceleration was quick and the brakes very capable of stopping on a dime  Seating appeared to be very  Recaro   a major manufacturer of quality car seats geared toward racing and for people requiring extra back  lumbar and leg support  Instrumentation was average  I swapped my speedometer and tachometer for a Saleen racing instrumentation panel  This increased my speedometer to 190 mph verses 95 mph  The clutch was defintely heavy duty  Unlike foreign vehicle clutches  the Mustang GT s clutch required leg work  It engaged very smoothly even at 90 000 miles  Air conditioning cooled the vehicle very fast in the heat of summer  The heater warmed the vehicle after ten minutes  The convenience panel was simple with levers operating both the air condition and heater  The premium sound system was better than average for a stock audio system  It had a built in equalizer which worked very well  I rarely played tapes because I found when the cassette deck gets too hot it tends to crunch tapes  My particular Mustang came equipped with Goodyear Gatorback  tires  This unique  V  shaped tread design was patterned after race tire specifications  At the time  these tires cost about  185 each  I always picked up some nail which flattened my tires many times  My local Goodyear dealer loved me Fuel consumption was average for a V8  I averaged 20 mpg on the highway and about 14 16 mpg in the city B STEVE S OVER ENGINEERED AWARDS  MY DISLIKES B   Upshift Indicator    Why would someone design a street racer with this foolish accessory  The upshift indicator lights up to tell you to upshift or down shift  This is to help you conserve fuel  I never used it  The light in this panel gave out after three years but I really didn t miss it     Stick shift    A bolt that held the stick shift split in two while I was driving on a congested freeway  I could not get the car into gear and caused a five mile back up  The bolt was a  2 part but I was charged  75 to replace it   Blind spot    There is a dangerous blind spot to the rear right of the vehicle  I highly recommend you do NOT rely on just turning your head to the right  LOOK in your rear view mirror and OUTSIDE rear mirror or you just may end up hitting a vehicle in your blind spot     Rear Seating    I rode in the rear of my Mustang on a long trip  My 5 11  frame got a mean nasty charley horse after sitting for three hours  Yes  I know it is considered a compact vehicle but a little more leg room would have been nice   STEVE S BOTTOM LINE  I really loved the styling of my Mustang  As the years progressed  I found I disliked the styling of the Mustangs which slowly began evolving to its current design which to me looks too  Japanese If I had the opportunity to purchase a 1985 Ford Mustang GT  I wouldn t hesitate in picking one up and perhaps refurbishing it  Will this car become a classic  It should retain some value due to the fact that it was the last of the carbureted 4 barrel Hollys  From 1986 on  the Mustangs had fuel injection  And  finally  I can still remember the first song I heard on the radio as I drove off the dealership s lot  it was       Careless Whispers by WHAM  Has it really been 16 years  
 With GM s recent announcement of their decision to discontinue the Camaro Firebird  that leaves on classic ponycar still in production today  The Ford Mustang The Ford Mustang is an American ponycar icon that still sells quite well in today s generation  During a recent test drive  I was able to experience first hand what driving a Mustang is all about EXTERIOR The Mustang is designed with classic muscle car looks  The large front grill with the classic pony suggests a mean  get out of my way attitude  The whole car s design is a real headturner in my opinion  I especially like the rear deck and tailight design which is the view most drivers had on the road while I drove this mustang  My mustang was painted performance red which looks outstanding on this car  INTERIOR Thus mustang s interior is fairly simply laid out  The instrument panel is very cleanly designed and easy to read  The optional Mach 460 sound system rocks for a factory installed system  Interior room is just average though  and quite tight in the rear seats  but this is a sports car  and thats expected  I think Ford could have done a better job on the seats  Since the mustang is a performance car  and most people will drive it hard  it could use better side bolstering to keep the driver in place while manuvering through traffic  Noise insulation is not great  but once again this is a sports car and that is expected ENGINE RIDE I drove a mustang GT equiped with ford s growly and powerful 4 6 V8  Horsepower is a very impressive 260 and the overwhelming power pushed me into my seat while accelerating hard from stoplights  The mustang s V8 makes a pleasent exhaust growl which is a true musclecar feature  The auto transmission mustang I drove had more than adequate power throughout the rev range  however  I think a manual would be more fun  The mustang s ride quality is just average  due to the tuned suspension which is designed for spirited driving  VALUE The mustang GT retails for anywhere between  21 000 24 000 depending on the level of equipment and options you select  This is one of the best  bang for your buck  vehicles on the market today  However the Mustang is very expensive to insure and previous Mustang s have had some repair issues and Ford doesn t have the greatest build quality reputation as with most domestic automakers  I would buy the mustang someday as a second car to drive on weekends  but wouldn t recommend it as an everyday car  Sports cars in general are not comfortable or practical to drive in everyday situations  But if you want a car that will get to where you need to go in very quickly with a lot of style and tradition  without breaking the bank  consider the Ford Mustang  
 I drove a Ford Explorer for three years and I liked it until I realized what I was missing  Because it was my first car I had nothing to compare it to  but after having driven other cars I realize that the Explorer is not that great  Its suspension and handling are really awful compared to other cars in its class and it cost me a ridiculous amount of money for gas and all too frequent repairs  I was comfortable inside it but that was probably because I shelled out about  8 000 above the starting price for extras  Although SUVs are traditionally intended more for off roading and that type of thing I assume most people buying one right now would be interested in driving it everyday as I did  which is not something I recommend br br  
 My 929 is also a 1992  I bought if with 54K in 1997 at age 5 years old  I purchased 36K and 3 years of more warranty  It was a Texas car and I live in Minnesota  For the rough winters  I wanted a rear drive  Seriously  I was planning to drive to Texas and needed a good road car  I liked the styling and I got it for  11K Almost three years later  no real problems  Using synthetic oil every 3 4K miles  Burns about a quart in that time  I commute 22 to and 22 back   work It now has 90K and seems fine  I believe it needs plugs and wires  I did the radiator at 79K when it broke and changed the timing belt at 70K to keep extended warranty going  It expired at 90K  I changed the transmission oil at 68K  A transmission mount was done under warranty about the radiator time  Normal brakes and tire wear I plan to keep it  Shocks in the rear were priced high at  400 and I fear the costly repairs that you faced  Most reviews I read are good value and fairly positive  My Mazda dealer seems to like them compared to Millenia  a big 626  they say  They compared the 929 to Mercedes  with its rear drive  Last of the rear drives  Not a good idea to have rear drive in Minnesota  home of snow  but not much ice  I fear the road salt  but so far the 8 years seem to show no rust  My wife s Jeep is doing well for a 1995 with same mileage So  I think my note counters your note  But I like your positive ending  It does drive well   quot Great road car quot  according to some  with 112 quot  wheelbase it ought to ride well  Some of the interior is falling out  Drivers seat wear is higher but the leather seems tough I wish you better luck  Some friends think it is good for 200K  The engine rattles a bit when cold but idles well and is quiet after warm up  I do not push it hard  Steady 60 70 on freeways to work  Some stop and go Larry Sullivan   
 I owned two Ford Rangers  First  1989 STX Ext Cab  and currently 1999 Ranger Standard Cab  Both 4WD  Something has happened in those 11 years  First Ranger I drove for 8 years  Ran great  4WD worked well nice bucket seats  solid build  good turning radius  but a bit under powered This current beast is an entirely different animal  It began to make questionable noises within my first year of ownership  I m 6ft1 and a little too big for the interior  Very uncomfortable and the seats did a number on my back Then came the recalls  1  Steering column wiper blinkers assembly 2  water pump 3  THE TIRES  which I must ad  are horrible quality  When I did some investigating  I found even more  features Now  I bet you re wondering if drive my vehicles hard  NOT AT ALL  I have owned this rolling nightmare for 30 months  and I only have 14K miles on it  All of which are basic city driving To  William Clay Ford  get to work you silver spooner  you just lost another customer  
 Silver   black  premium package  3 0  Daily driver Other cars I own are a 1997 Mazda Miata and a 2001 BMW M Coupe  I also have spent significant time driving a 2001 Porsche 911 Cabriolet The engine is fabulous  It has great torque and makes the most seductive sound  rendering the radio moot  The 3 0 is easier to live with than the 3 2 in my M Coupe in that its less raw  The interior is very nice  especially the wood accents  The top does allow a bit of wind noise with the top up around the door seals  Those who would say that wind noise is to be expected in a convertable have not ridden in a Mercedes SL or Porsche 996 Cabriolet The car handles great  It lives up to the BMW boast   We make our engines fast  but our suspensions faster  Unlike the Miata  the Z3 transmits road irregularities with the  thwomp  associated with high quality luxury cars The interior is roomy enough for my 6 2  33  inseam frame  The premium sound system sounds great but is more prone to skipping than the unit that came with my Miata  The skipping in my M Coupe indicates that this may be a chronic BMW problem  The trunk is silly The exterior is a personal choice  but suffice it to say that after 5 years  this car still turns heads I wish the car came with Xenon HID headlights  rain sensor  auto dimming mirror  auto tilt in reverse passenger side mirror  fully automatic top  glass rear window  and steering wheel controls  Of course  I ve just listed items found in roadsters costing much more than the Z3 3 0  Its merely nitpicking after all  I bought the car for the engine  and on that point  it has not let me down Other bonuses include the 3 year all service included warranty  and the fact that dealers are making drastic discounts right now If you re caught between the Miata MR2 S2000 crowd and the 911 SL XK8 SC430 crowd  this car provides alot of bang for the buck  
 There s a reason why the BMW 3 Series is the best selling vehicle in BMW s entire lineup  and why it has been continually praised by numerous automobile magazines   because it truly is a fantastic all around sedan  I recently purchased a 2001 Jet Black 325i sedan with premium package for about  33 000  I haven t stopped smiling since First off  I must praise the mechanics of the smooth 2 5 liter inline six that powers the 325i  Although admittedly low on horsepower  184  and torque  the engine always stays quiet  and has a remarkable idle RPM of about 600  Despite the sub 200 horsepower figure  however  the car still feels more than nimble and confident enough to pass traffic or speed up going up a hill  thanks to the valve timing and lift system of the BMW engine  known simply as  Double VANOS How does the car handle  Brilliantly  The speed sensitive rack and pinion steering provides plenty of road feel  so that the driver never feels disconnected with the road  Unlike the steering feel in most Japanese automobiles  the steering in the 325i is very sensitive and instantly responsive  just so much as tap the steering wheel in any direction  and the car predictably changes its course accordingly The ride is almost always smooth  and the car maintains its composure over even the bumpiest of roads  thanks to the so called  z axle  double wishbone suspension in the rear  Since I didn t opt to purchase the sport package  which includes a sport tuned suspension  there is noticeable body roll on the vehicle during sharp turns  but I preferred the smoother ride of the car without the sport setup  The 5 speed automatic transmission  known as  Sportronic  works great and shifts predictably  I enjoy using the  sport  mode of the transmission  where the engine is allowed to rev to higher RPMS before changing gears  This provides excellent highway passing power The interior  although rather bland  is composed of high quality materials  with soft touch plastics and a rich wood trim  if you opt for it  My only complaint here is the lack of options on a base 325i  want lighting for the rear passengers  It ll cost you  Want a cd player  It ll cost you  Want leather  It ll cost you  And the list goes on  with amenities such as an auto dimming rear view mirror and alarm system   that one would expect to be standard on a luxury sedan placed on the list of options  A word of warning  be careful with the options  or you could end up spending upwards of  38 000 One thing that IS standard on all BMWs  however  is safety  Included with every 3 Series are  smart  front and side airbags for the driver and passenger  the Head Protection System  head airbags  for the passenger and driver  DSC  dynamic stability control  which controls oversteer and understeer  DBC  dynamic brake control  which modulates braking pressure in emergency situations  AST  all season traction control  anti lock brakes  and a side impact door anchoring system  which protects the driver and passenger in side impact collisions  Also  in the event of an accident  the battery terminal cable is immediately cut to prevent the risk of fire Overall  I would not hesitate to recommend this vehicle to others  However  I would strongly suggest to those that are able to pay extra to spring for the 225 horsepower 330i  In all truth  power is the only shortcoming of the 325i  
 I have a 1993 Ford Taurus with a V6 3 8L engine  The Ford Taurus is a nice car  It is very roomy for a family of four  There is plenty of trunk space and is a comfortable ride for family trips However  at 50 000 miles the head gasket cracked  Coolant was leaking into the exhaust system causing billowing white smoke to come out of the tail pipe  I opted for a rebuilt engine as purchasing another car was out of the question as a car with a cracked head has little trade in value Now  Ford has increased the warranty for 1994 and 1995 Taurus vehicles with 3 8L engines to 7 years or 100 000 miles  According to the letter  if you have already paid to have the head gasket repaired  prior to the date of this letter  March  2000  you may be entitled to a refund of your repair costs  Obviously  Ford has had lots of complaints and bad press concerning their 3 8L engine  Ann O Neill  director of Vehicle Service and Programs even states that Ford  quot is committed to maintaining satisfying and and long term relationships with our valued customers  and demonstrating that commitment through actions such as this quot  I guess I am not a valued customer as Ford told me that there is no recourse because my model year is 1993  It is a low mileage car as it is now close to 7 years old with 61 000 miles of which 11 000 is on the second engine  My car clearly fit the textbook case of what they were trying to correct with 1994 models As previous reviewers of the Taurus have stated  there is no gray area with rules  only black and white with Ford br br  
 After bugging my husband for a year to get me a new car  he finally broke down and we started looking  We looked for months to find the one that we really wanted and kept on coming back to look at the Explorers  After test driving them I knew that this was my dream car  Buying a new one was just not in our budget  but we found a 95  that we could fit in for payments      I have had it for almost a year now  and it is the BEST  I love the way it looks  drives  handles and all of the extra add ons that it came with  When it comes time for a new car again  Explorers will be the first thing I go and look at again br br  
 I just got back from a trip to Northern California  I rented a mirage for the trip  I love this car  Not only did it ride very smooth but I saved about  25 00 in gas on the trip  It got very good gas milage  I love this car so much I am now going to buy one  Never did I think I would choose a foreign car over an american made one but I am  It has power steering which made my trip better and much more relaxing  The suspension was wonderful  I would recommend this car to all my friends   The cons however well I just can t find any This in my opinion is the best foreign car on the market br br  
 I am still driving my 93 Regal   bought it new and just hit 250 000 miles  I can t believe how durable this car is  The biggest problem is the air conditioner  I need to get it fixed about once every year  I have heard that this is a common problem with this model year  Also  there is some kind of flaw in the way the brakes were designed that causes the rotors to wear out about every 50 000 miles or so  However  these are the biggest problems I have had with this car  The only other parts I have replaced are the alternator at around 150 000 miles and the starter around the same time  Otherwise  the engine still runs great  transmission shifts flawlessly and in general the car runs perfectly  Still has lots of power and has never given me any trouble  Someone else s review said that there is not much leg room in the back seat  Well  I would have to agree with that  Don t buy one of these if you re going to have a bunch of 6 5  guys in the back  But if you re looking for a great  reliable car you will get plenty of bang for your buck with the Regal  Mine s still going strong and I have no plans to trade it in any time soon  
 I bought my used  89 S 10 because I had to replace my Cimmaron a deer fell head over heels for  I like the get up and go  economy with power  The truck looks good  runs good  and is actually quite easy to work on if one is of the mind and body to maintain his her own vehicle  I have replaced the water pump  starter  alternator  and brake calipers on mine  But don t be misled  The truck has almost 190 000 miles  Almost every part is available at auto parts stores and is reasonably priced  The air conditioning will cool off even the biggest hothead behind the wheel  The engine gets to normal running temperature in little time and the heater works very well on even the coldest mornings  The air conditioner does not bog the engine hardly at all  and the aerodynamics of the vehicle make it more economical to run the air conditioning as opposed to running with the windows down due to reduced drag  The truck is very stable at high speeds  60 75 mph  and handles well in the curves  even for one who prefers front wheel drive for stability  I would recommend this truck to anyone who wants a light  to mid duty truck that performs as well as it looks  Mine is just a work commuter truck  so it runs better than it looks br br  
 After I sold my previous car  a very nice 1994 Taurus SHO  I decided I needed something a little nicer  My choices were either a Ford  Lincoln  or Mercury because my father owns a few car dealerships  I went to an auction with him and picked out a great looking 97 Eddie Bauer Explorer  First of all I love how high this vehicle rides  you can really see everything around you  I noticed in my SHO that there were some blind spots  in my Explorer there are none  The interior of this vehicle is great  There is loads of space  When I moved to college in August I fit nearly everything I needed into the Explorer  with the seats folded down  Ford always makes durable products  The only thing that this vehicle needs is regular servicing  I never took this vehicle in to get repairs  Pulling two jet skis is quite a easy with the Eddie Bauer Explorer due to the 5 0 V8  It s quite an engine  My only dispute with the power is that it goes to all four wheels instead of just two because of All Wheel Drive  This vehicle could be quite the speedster Control is great because of the all wheel drive and ABS so it s a great vehicle for winters  I never felt like I was out of control this past winter  My major complaint with this vehicle is the gas mileage  I mostly drove in town and my bill was so much more than when I drove my Taurus  I estimate that it was twice as much  The control center in the vehicle read around 14 mpg in town  Another thing that I didn t like was the average handling  The center of gravity was high on this vehicle and I could notice it on SHARP corners  I felt quite safe though on curvy highways  Overall this vehicle is a great buy  It has great power  room  and durability with the only real problem being gas mileage br br  
 This past weekend  we purchased a 1998 Mustang GT Convertible  We were not even shopping for a car and drove by a local Mercedes dealership on our way to have my truck washed  It was on the rack and immediately caught my eye  I couldn t believe I had to show it to my husband  as he usually spots every single Mustang within view  He immediately turned around and was out of the truck and up on the rack in a matter of minutes This car was in excellent condition and was exactly what my husband had wanted  It was THE color  THE GT  THE MUSTANG for him period  The salesman came over and took it off the rack and my husband sat in it and immediately  I knew  somehow  we were going to have this car  This was the Saturday before Memorial Day  After a week of trying to find a way to get to the payment we could afford  we were able to come to a deal  after both my husband and the salesman getting close to an ulcer  We drove in that car all day Saturday and Sunday  This car is very  very comfortable to ride in  We have two small children  ages 2 and 5 and were pleasantly surprised how much room there was in the back for them  Our F150 has been our family vehicle  but I think that this Mustang will turn out to be the main family vehicle  at least until the boys outgrow that back seat  My 2 year old is in a car seat and there was plenty of room for me to recline a little and give myself plenty of leg room without cramping his feet between his car seat and the back of my seat  We first used his regular car seat and it was a little cramped  My husband got down the booster seat that my oldest boy used and it fit much better  please note that this booster seat has the chest harness that the carseat used it s not just the booster that uses the car s seatbelt system he is too young for that one  My 5 year old is still a little short for the seatbelt in the back seat so we got his little booster chair and the car s seatbelt then worked great  it was then resting more on his shoulder than his neck A little more information on the back seat  Most every sports car I have ever seen never had a back seat that was more than a place to put the dog or groceries  This back seat is a real back seat  granted it s not for most men  but I think the average woman could be comfortable  as long as it s not a terribly long drive  I must tell you that my husband is 6 3 quot  so he really has his seat back far  If there were a shorter person in the driver s seat  and they did not need to go so far back  there would be more room behind that seat to fit a little more comfortably  We had my 5 year old back there and he had room enough to kick his feet  even with the seat back enough for my husband to be comfortable Now  the features  This car is loaded  Of course  it has the convertible top  which is all electronically handled  I have never had to put the top up or down on a car before  so I wasn t sure how much better this was than others  but my husband and his best friend commented on how easy it was to latch the top compared to other convertibles they had been in  It has power everything  standard  driver s seat  windows  locks  mirrors  Power steering and tilt are standard  It has dual passenger air bags  intermittent wipers  leather steering wheel  rear spoiler whew The additional options that are on this vehicle are  Cruise control  rear window defrost  alarm system  anti lock brakes  leather seats  Whoever originally owned this vehicle wanted all the extras  I personally would have gotten an automatic transmission  since I can t drive a stick  However  my husband insists that you have to have a 5 speed in this car I am sure that most sports car buffs are the same way It comes with the remote entry system  which includes the alarm   A note on the car alarm  It is the type that actually shuts the starting system down once activated even once the alarm noise has stopped  you cannot start this car unless you use the remote to turn off the alarm  This entry system also has remote trunk release  The back window is glass  not the cheap plastic that used to come on convertibles  and has a rear defrost that works quickly  we got some rain this weekend and had to use the defrost  Speaking of rain  we were in several downpours and did not have one little leak  It comes with foglamps  standard  Of course  it has air conditioning even with the top down in the Texas heat  you still need that air conditioner  The air conditioning is standard for this vehicle  The stereo system is awesome it comes standard with both CD and tape players  The sound is great we had to try out the bass and it is deep and had no rattles  There are speakers up on the doors by the windows and there are speakers just behind the front seats built in to the side walls  They are aimed at the front seat  so you pretty much get surround sound quality  The CD player is separate from the tape player  which is built into the stereo  Unlike most car stereos  I don t think my husband would want to replace this one The gas mileage was surprisingly good  The tank holds 15 gallons and we were able to go about 210 miles on just under half a tank  This was highway mileage  with a little stop and go because of the heavy rain  The rating is 24 mpg highway  but I can t remember the city mileage  My husband drives mainly on the highway  so that is really what we look at  We figure he will get about 350 400 miles to a tank of gas  This is good  considering the gas prices right now  I am not a sports car buff  but I know that the engine in this thing is supposed to be one of the best  It is a V 8  5 speed  I think my husband said the engine is a  quot 302 quot  Apparently this engine was made to take abuse well  One of his friends had one in one of his Mustang s and he said that he really abused that engine and never had trouble with it  This is good to know  cause we can t afford a lot of repair work on this thing right now  This brings up another issue reliability  I have read up on this too  Consumer Reports showed a pretty good reliability record and Edmund s says that the Mustang is known for it s reliability  Like I said  I m not a  quot car guy quot  but it does seem like this car is made for a sports car junky like my husband I still am a little apprehensive about a convertible   safetywise   but other than not having a  quot solid quot  top  I think this car would handle a wreck well  It is heavy and I have read up on the safety information and it is one of the safest sports cars in a crash  I think that this is typical for Ford vehicles  I used to be a GM person  but ever since I bought my first Ford  I would never buy another GM product  As long as we don t roll over  I believe that we are safer in this vehicle than any other sports car I ve been in  and even safer than a  quot regular quot  car made by GM  I have really noticed the difference between how solid the Ford vehicles are compared to GM and can honestly say that I feel much safer in a Ford than a GM vehicle Overall  I can highly recommend this vehicle if you want a sporty car that is comfortable to ride in  not one in which you feel every bump in the road  It can fit a family of four  with small children  comfortably  and has a decent size trunk for suitcases  or in my husband s case  golfclubs  Oh  that reminds me  there is a cover that goes over the opening when the top is down  that way you don t have this gapping whole behind the back seat when the top is down  We looked at the newer Mustang GT convertibles and I think the only difference is that the 1999 and later have anti lock brakes  this one doesn t  If you can find one of these cars that have been as babied as this one was  I wouldn t hesitate to buy it br br  
 I bought this car after reading several positive reviews in the auto magazines  It has been everything I hoped for  considering my budget and needs I needed a four door sedan  for the kids sake  However  I wanted a six cyl  engine with a 5 speed manual transmission  This left me with the Contour or the Mazda 626 or Camary  both of which  were out of my price range I love the engine on this car  With 170 horses on tap  it really moves great  It comes on the cam at about 4 000 rpm and pulls very strongly until peak revs  Many have complained about the poor feel of the manual transmission  I replaced the standard Ford fluid with synthetic  which definitely improved it  It s not silky smooth like a Honda s  but it is adequate  Unlike some others  I like the reverse gear lock out  which required you to pull up on a ring to shift the transmission into reverse  It gives me added confidence when making downshifts on the highway The four wheel disc brakes are powerful  but seem to warp very easily  I always seem to have a bit of a shutter  within 3 months of getting a brake job The fuel economy is a little worse than I expected  but given the powerful engine  it s something that I can live with I ve had two design related problems  The water pump impeller on my engine broke  leaving me stranded on the highway  Usually water pumps break due to bearing failure  A broken impeller is highly unusual and is apparently common on this engine  I also had a coil spring break on a Macpherson strut  This resulted in un even tire wear  so I ended up having to prematurely get new tires  I don t think that spring breaks are common  It s probably a design defect as well Speaking of tires  the tire sizes on my GL are weird   195 65 R14 s   which are hard to find  This usually means that I can t get tires on sale Owners of this car seem to love it and even have their own web site  www contour org  
 I ve had this car for quite some time now and have loved every bit of it  Who says nice German cars cost too much money I wanted something different from the crowd of Japanese cars out there  Looks wise it is a winner but that is not the only reason  You must check out the attention to detail in the interior   both the front seats have airbags  lumbar adjustments and height adjustments  Too often such privileges are reserved only for the driver seat  Both the front windows are one touch up one touch down  most other cars just have one touch down and feature what VW calls pinch protection   if the glass encounters a finger  or neck  on its way up it automatically stops and reverses  The chrome plate for the gear looks very elegant  Also note how the handles above the doors will slowly recess back when you leave them   its very cool to watch   Plus all the controls are back lighted at night so you dont have to grope around   even the door controls for the rear seat  Now that I haven t seen in Camrys or Accords  The blue lighting for the instrument panel and the red needles really sold me  And for some reason there is an AC vent in the glovebox   I haven t tried storing chocolates there but its good to show people You can also open all the windows without entering the car by using the key   pretty neat capability eh  Even the key to the car smacks of high quality   its the same as the Audi  You even have a valet key though I m not that rich to use it This is the only car in this price range which offers you Tiptronic option  My favorite place to use it is when I m first at a traffic light   it feels awesome to floor the pedal and speed away  The engine is the same as Audi A4   1 8l but turbocharged and feels very smooth  The car handling is very precise and I like to push it especially on sharp turns  The seats are comfortable after adjustments   I ve driven for 3 4 hrs at a stretch  In normal driving it has a kind of a low gentle roar when you drive at midrange rpms  The trunk has enormous room and the circular roof of the car offers a lot of headroom  And with the 6CD changer and premium sound system it positively rocks I intended to buy a sports car  being young and what not  but who cares if its a sports car or a nice looking sedan as long as its fun to drive Update 10th July 2000  16months I ve gone through two oil changes and have had no problems  The car handles great  no rattles  nothing  I ve made two long trips  gt 1000miles  without any problems  There is enough room in the backseat for someone to play the guitar  And the trunk can hold lots of stuff Update 5th Jan 2000  22months Another free oil change and another 2000  mile trip without any problems  Some comments from friends who have been driving    quot great acceleration quot   going from 80 gt 120 left a Taurus in the dust   quot very smooth quot  etc br br  
 I am a  car guy  Unlike many car guys gals who can seem almost militant in their devotion to their favorite cars  I believe I keep an open mind when evaluating cars other than my favorite brand  which coincidentally happens to be Ford  incidentally  I currently own Nissan and Acura products  I try to keep up on all the latest trends in personal transportation  and when my friends and family need info on cars  they know they can count on me for an honest opinion  I recently helped some close friends buy a new compact car  and after trying out and evaluating several products from all around the world  they bought a Ford Focus For those of you who follow automotive trends  you may have noticed that American carmakers have dramatically improved the quality and variety of their products in the last 15 years  In my opinion  Ford has done the best job of designing interest  excitement  and quality into their vehicles  The new Ford Focus is proof positive of this Ford has created a new standard for the economy car with this vehicle  The Focus is a spacious  comfortable mid size car on the inside  and a fuel sipping zippy compact machine on the outside  It s fun  Headroom is particularly impressive in this car  and the upright seating is easy on the back and legs on those long trips  I could definitely survive a road trip in the back seat   wouldn t want to try that in most other small cars  The dashboard is straightforward and friendly  All the knobs and switches have an expensive feel to them   kind of what you d expect in a much pricier car  Even the fake wood trim is more convincing and less offensive than you typically see in American cars   personally  I d rather not have it though Engine and suspension performance is at the top of the class  neck and neck with other top economy cars  such as the new Nissan Sentra and the Mazda Protege  Although engine noise is pronounced under hard acceleration  it is not offensive the way a lesser car might be Ford doesn t skimp on the standard features  although they should make side airbags standard rather than an option  and the fresh look of the Focus makes it stand out among most other economy cars   love or hate it  it gets noticed  Ford offers enough variety in the way of trim levels and options to satisfy most anybody I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a fun  reliable small car that drives like a more expensive  bigger car  Focus on a car in a flavor other than vanilla JULY UPDATE    I m happy to report that my friends couldn t be more pleased with their choice of the Focus  After several months and several thousand miles  they find the car to be a joy to drive  They are particularly impressed with the handling in all weather conditions  and told me that the car inspires great confidence APRIL  2001 UPDATE    My friends still love their Focus  and have had no problems to date  I m going on vacation next month  and went out of my way to set up a five day rental on a Focus  so I ll add more after I ve spent some time in the rental  
 When my husband needed another car two years ago  we went to the dealer to look at used Lincolns  We were very fortunate to find a 1995 Lincoln Town Car with just over 20 000 miles  This car was in mint condition with not a nick or dent anywhere on the body  The interior was spotless and looked like it had never been driven  We asked who had been driving it and the salesman told us it had been leased by a major company that supplies all their executives with Lincoln Town Cars  That explained the low mileage  The driver more than likely had his her own luxury car cars that were used for family trips  etc  This car had probably only been used to drive to work and had its own parking space  hence the lack of nicks on the doors  This is something to look for when buying a used car check on availability of this type of leased car We test drove the car and were immediately sold  We drove some of the newer models and didn t find them to have as comfortable a ride as the 95  I guess it s the length of the model  It glides along the road and you don t feel the bumps  We bought the car We have found the Lincoln Town Car to be wonderful on long trips  You just don t get as tired when you have the ability to change the seats so easily without stopping  Because of the way the car glides along with little effort  you don t get as much fatigue  The size and weight of the car also makes you feel safer on today s high speed roads  The leather seats are comfortable year round and the size of the seats gives everyone comfort  The back seat is just as comfortable  The trunk has ample room for a families  needs on a trip  Grocery shopping is much simpler when there is so much room in the trunk as well We have had absolutely no problems with our Lincoln and have only needed to take it in to the dealer for regular service  Whenever we do  within a few days we receive a phone call asking if we were satisfied with the service or had any problems  The answer is always  quot We are happy no problems quot  The dealer s service department has been excellent and always leaves the car clean after working on it  That is not the case with our other car  I find I am wiping black fingerprints of grease off something or other When we are ready to get another big car  it will definitely be a Lincoln br br  
 Until yesterday  I never owned a Ford product  I have owned a half dozen Chevrolets  two Korean cars  a Dodge  a Pontiac and a Plymouth  I have never considered myself to be loyal to General Motors  even though I have bought the majority of my cars from them  I simply have failed to find a Ford vehicle that appealed to me  the Mustang being the only exception  I recently decided it was time to buy a larger SUV  I have impeccable timing  It appears that gas prices are prepared to reach two dollars a gallon by the end of the month  and no decision yet forthcoming from OPEC regarding increased oil production  However  I did not base my decision on gas prices  I was looking for a large SUV to accommodate my growing family  If gasoline prices were my only concern  I probably couldn t afford this vehicle anyway While I was conducting my research to purchase a larger SUV  I checked out the Chevy Blazer  the Dodge Durango  the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Ford Expedition  I didn t care for the Chevy Blazer at all  The styling and lack of room were my main considerations concerning the Blazer  The Jeep Grand Cherokee was much more attractive than the Blazer  but like the Blazer  it provided minimal room with a hefty price tag  The Dodge Durango was a close call  I love the styling  the inside was spacious and the truck handles well  The options on the Dodge Durango give it a luxurious feel that was absent on the Jeep and Chevy  The Expedition I test drove was a used 1997 Eddie Bauer Expedition  Everything I was looking for came together in one package  A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN  The Expedition was spacious  attractive  comfortable and handled well  Did I mention that is was attractive The Eddie Bauer Expedition runs around  40 000 new  I was able to knock a third off that price by buying a 1997 with 25 000 miles on it  The truck gets terrible gas mileage  but not any worse than the Chevy conversion van I used to own  The main page lists a different gas mileage from what the Expedition paperwork reveals  The description I read before writing this lists the gas mileage at 14 18 in reality  it is 12 16  The listing also states that this vehicle seats 6  The Expedition seats 5 unless there is a third row of seats  in which case it seats 8  Now that I have gotten the discrepancies cleared up  I will move on to the other attributes of this SUV b What are the positive aspects of the Expedition b  The Eddie Bauer version of the Ford Expedition has many redeeming qualities  The first thing you notice upon approaching this vehicle is the two tone color scheme  There are a variety of colors to choose from  The Expedition I purchased is a deep maroon with tan trim  The trim adds a beautiful accent to the appearance of this truck  The interior is equally attractive  The leather seats are comfortable and provide ample back support  The front seats provide additional lumbar support  which can be adjusted to your personal taste  The driver s seat adjusts up  down  forward and backward  to give the driver a wide range of positions to get comfortable  The control panels are lighted  allowing the driver to find the buttons he needs  even in the dark  I have an average build  5  10 quot  180  and was able to easily reach all the controls b Other Options I like b  The Eddie Bauer Expedition has an electric sunroof  power windows  to include the two windows in the cargo area  power seats  leather interior  six CD Changer  cruise control  front and rear A C  front and rear radio controls  and running board lighting  The Triton V 8 engine provides plenty of power for easy acceleration  This truck handles well and is very easy to operate b What are the drawbacks b  This truck is certainly not for everyone  With a sticker price starting around  40 000 new  it is expensive  The expense is further increased at the gas pump  The 30 gallon tank costs around 45 dollars to fill up  and will probably cost 60 dollars by the end of the month  Although the description on Epinions lists the gas mileage at 14 18  and the paperwork I received lists it at 12 16  I was averaging 10 MPG yesterday  That was normal city driving  without rapid acceleration  At 10 MPG  this truck is a gas guzzler  Environmentally and economically it is a bust  Of course  that is something you must consider before purchasing a car  Another drawback is the size  For me  size was a positive  I love the roominess that this SUV provides for my family  However  that means additional size to park or squeeze through tight spaces  My last truck was a Kia Sportage  which I could park anywhere  The Expedition needs additional clearance My overall impression of the Ford Expedition is positive  The negative aspects of the truck are not high on my list of priorities  The items that ARE high on my list of priorities are fulfilled in this vehicle  Among the other SUV s that I tested  the Ford Expedition was heads above the rest     
 As a new vehicle this was a grand choice  I have the V 6 LX Model which is by far a more well rounded vehicle than the Turbo GT Model  I have found the reliability to be greater than the Turbo as well  However all cars age  and the Probe has done better than most other American cars I ve experienced  but holds no match to a foreign make  Normal wear items  like both CV Joints have failed  as well as the car now eats  literally  brake pads  Some other items have died early on  such as the A C Unit has not worked in a while  and looks to cost over  800 to repair  Also the fan switch for the climate control has quit  This should be a normal relay  but everyone I consult as well as my manuals say I need Climate Control parts because it has a high tech system  However it does not have Automatic Climate Control to my knowledge  The body has held up well  just recently falling victim to surface rust  and that sin a harsh New England Climate  It has a leak in the rear  somewhere  according to Ford  that causes some havoc on the electrical system every now and then  To purchase one now would be risky  I would recommend searching long and hard for a perfect model br br  
 I have had a 98  Contour for 2 years now and have no regrets  This car is a dependable solid sporty vehicle  I would reccomend it to anyway to go by one before it s too late  They are still making them in Mexico for about 1 more year  This year you can only get the Contour SE with the V6 Duratec or the SVT  Ford dropped the 4 cyclinder and all other models of the Contour  I would reccomend the Silver Frost color as well  It is easy to wax out any small scrathes and does not show the dirt and grime as much as other colors  The only problem I have  and it is a small problem  I cannot change my air filter because one you get the clamps off  it is very difficult to get the clamps reclamped because there is no room from the surrounding engine compartment  The clamps are also very flimsy and I have noticed that after 2 years of driving  I am missing 1 and they are corroding  Is anybody else having the same problem  I dare not let my local oil change shop change my air filter because I don t trust they could clamp it down  as a result I have been forced to take the car into the dealer every other oil change and have them change the filter Speaking of oil change  my fiance owns a  99 Volkswagon Cabrio  She was over mileage for an oil change by only 400 miles  so I decided to check her oil for her  Well it was a good thing because she was extremely low and I had to go immediately to a gas station for oil Meanwhile my  98 Contour was coming almost at the 5 000 mile mark for an oil change so I decided that it would be wise to check my oil as well  What a surprise  the oil was still full AND clean  I m tellin you Ford made a big mistake by building and solid dependable car and letting it sit by the wayside with absolutely no marketing  What a waste br br  
 We had the  pleasure  of driving a 2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara as a rental car while our car was in the shop for repairs  When we had the car there was approx  12 500 miles on it  I thought the front seats were very roomy and comfortable the head rest was even high enough so that my 6 5 quot  husband could comfortably use it  He also had enough leg space to drive comfortably  and the steering wheel adjusted high enough so he did not bump his legs when turning the wheel This vehicle was close enough to the ground to get in and out of  yet high enough to let you be up there to see the road and everything around you very well  I thought the ride was very smooth and quiet  The few times we actually drove with the windows up we were very surprised at how quiet the car was  I could barely hear anything  The Grand Vitara also rode very easily along the roads  Not bumpy like some of the older mini SUV s like a Geo Tracker or Suzuki Sidekick  I was impressed with that The model we drove came with a remote control key ring to lock and unlock the doors  Simple to use  push the respectable button and the doors either lock or unlock  Push both buttons and it sets off the panic alarm  One thing I didn t like is that when you locked unlocked the doors with the key ring the headlights flashed and the horn beeped once  This is just a personal peeve of mine  I did have a small problem driving this vehicle  I am 5 6 quot  tall  and I had problems using my main rearview mirror  The back seats are just as tall as the front seats and that obstructed my view a bit  as well as the spare tire hanging on the back  About 1 3 of the tire was in the window mirror area and it made it hard to see I also felt the back seats were too small  If my husband was driving the car  he would have to put the seat all the way back to get his legs to fit in there  that leaves close to no leg space for the passenger behind him  When we had my son in his car seat back there the drivers seat was about 2 3 inches from his legs  The  trunk space  is also VERY limited  We put our stroller in there and a few of hubbies uniforms from the seamstress shop and that was about it for the room  We have MUCH more room in our midsize sedan trunk  The Grand Vitara did have a roof rack though  so for trips you could compensate with one of those cases that sit up there The model we drove was power windows and doorlocks  Every passenger had a window button only the driver had the lock button  The thing I didn t like was that the driver had control of the window lock  but it s either all or none  So If we want the back window locked for the kidlet the front one needs to be locked as well  I would like to see some control on the passenger side as well so the driver doesn t need to be bothered with this I felt that there wasn t a lot of pickup to this vehicle  While waiting at a light it seemed to be VERY slow in getting to the desired speed  I thought that the people behind me were going to have a fit cause I wasn t moving fast enough for them  Again my sedan performs better in this department and I was surprised  I really thought this vehicle would have some kick to it I felt a little shaky with the braking system as well  I m not sure if it s just something you had to get used to or what  but when you tap on the brakes  the car jerks to stop  they are very sensitive  but they don t feel safe to me  It s hard to explain  but I wouldn t feel safe trying to stop on a rainy day  Like I said it might just be something you have to get used to I know it s just for safety measures  but the drivers side sun visor said right there  quot this vehicle has a higher risk of rolling over quot  Just seeing that made me really scared to turn more than 5 miles per hour Depending on your needs  this might be a cute car for you  It s sporty and has a smooth ride  I personally wouldn t buy one  I can t put my finger quite on it  I just have a feeling that I shouldn t have this car even though this is the  type  of car I am looking to purchase in the near future  I would rather put my dollars on a Toyota Rav4 or a Honda CRV br br  
 It s great to see this car get posted   Aug  03  because I had the pleasure to take a 2004 Grand Prix on a 650 mile test drive in late June of 2003 Enterprise Rent a Car had just stocked a 2004 Grand Prix  and categorized it as a Full Size car  I drive a Bonneville  so I know what full size is  and this wasn t it  But surprisingly  I did not feel crammed into it s driver seat  However this is with the seat all the way back  and the steering wheel all the way up  I couldn t pass up the chance to enjoy a brand new car with less than 500 miles on it so I took the Grand Prix for a grand tour  I am guessing it was the standard Grand Prix because it did not specify any other letters after the name  and because it s a rental car  My call to the Enterprise location prior to writing this review was met with one too many  huh  what  responses to continue inquiring  So I am putting this under the generic Grand Prix heading  The Pontiac web site identifies the lowest priced Grand Prix as the GT 1  so maybe that s what it was  I did notice right away that we were getting extended looks from almost anyone that was also in an older Grand Prix or Grand Am  Very few folks have a 2004 out on the road  and if you are a fan of the model  it s understandable that a newer model would catch your eye  This 2004 model was close enough to 2003 for me that I walked up to the wrong car in a parking lot at the beach  wondering why repeatedly pressing the keyless entry button was getting no response  I was a couple cars off  and not paying attention because the body has changed for 2004  They made the 2004 s body more curvy  a bit more  muscle car  looking  and the fog lamps are far more pronounced  The back appears to sit higher with a retooled rear reflector lights pattern  The rear appears to sit higher due to the body s shape than actual height  As a result  the rear windows are very small and high  probably up to the neck of a rear seat passenger  I can t say that I know what that s like though  because no way I was going to scrunch into that back seat  The back seat would be no prize for an average 6ft male if the front seats were in normal position  With our seat back as far as it could go  the rear seat occupants would have to be from Cirque Du Soleil  Perhaps this was the sacrifice when they designed the 60 40  percent  split folding rear seat  I had nothing to bulky enough to warrant using the folding seat configuration  but the trunk alone was very roomy for a car this size  We set out for the Maryland eastern shore from Northern New Jersey for a weekend  I found the Grand Prix very easy to maneuver  This is my first time with what Pontiac deemed it s  wide track  design  The Bonneville has always been low and wide since it s major design change in 1992  A few years ago  they decided to widen the Grand Am and the Grand Prix to appeal to those that want to capture that roadster feel and those customers that want more stability  What the heck do I know  I don t work for Road and Track magazine  The four wheel independent suspension felt like it was working it s magic  Hard to be critical  because a brand new car is going to ride like a cloud more times than not  All I know is  being a big wide guy  after the seat and wheel adjustments  I slid into and out of the cockpit just fine  Now  mind you  it s no Bonneville  The space was there  but it was not cavernous  It should be more than enough for the average sized person  I also noticed that this Grand Prix gave a tad more room for your right leg and foot to the right of the gas pedal  So many cars have center consoles that widen out as they get under the dash  and the accelerator  gas  pedal is schooched over to the left a little too far for a comfortable extension of one s leg in long distance driving  I had to adjust how I positioned my leg after years of driving my Bonneville brought on knee pains  This Grand Prix allowed me to give my right leg easy pedal reach without buckling under and to the left  Again  I don t want to wear out the fact that I m a big guy  but this is a factor when I drive  This model Grand Prix had a CD player  and all the buttons and dials are easy to reach  The headlight switch took a minute to get the hang of  It was located on the steering column  identical to  but on the opposite side of the turn signal stem  It allows you to option the Daytime Running Lights  and the  Auto  feature that does that also cuts off your headlights automatically after you turn off the car  The dashboard dials and MPH dial is bright and easy to read  Pontiac highlights the 3800 V6 engine  A V 6 should be a given minimum on any thing higher than the most basic econo buggy  so that s no big whoop  but they say the 3800 series 3 V6 is the largest in it s class  I did feel a great response to some peppy footwork  I am not the  jackrabbit start  type  but I did want to see how well it came out of the blocks when the light turned green  Without being one of those morons that really blast off  I was able to get out ahead and over to another lane quite easily  When you find yourself sandwiched between tractor trailers on a highway  it s nice to have the jets available when you need to call on them  Here s what the Pontiac web site says about the Grand Prix s ETC    Electronic Throttle control  standard for 2004 b The only car in its class with this standard technology  speed based ETC replaces the mechanical link between the accelerator pedal and throttle with electronic controls to provide immediate response  By tuning the throttle to 19 speed based calibrations  this drive by wire system precisely modulates vehicle behavior for composure in parking lots and responsiveness on the highway b I knew there was something exceptional in it s quickness  Replaces the mechanical link between pedal and throttle with electronic controls  huh  Loose translation  Don t take this baby to Moe at the corner garage who worked on your father s Dodge Dart  No offense  but a generic repair lot strewn with assorted heaps is no place to take a 2004 car  As much as it pained me  I had to leave the music playing to my wife in the passenger seat  No one should expect to change a CD in any dash player safely while driving  The Stereo AM FM CD player in this car had more buttons and dials than most full sized stereos  When you drive out of your normal familiar radio stations  range  and are searching for new stations  have common sense and don t try to drive and tune  I don t know if air conditioning is that important a gradeable feature  but one of the reasons we rent for long distance summer car trips is that our eleven year old car s much fussed over AC puts out nothing  The AC in the Grand Prix cooled the interior in minutes after baking in 90 degree heat  We actually jumped in it to cool off midway through our day on the boardwalk in Ocean City MD  I recommend this car  based on how it drove as a brand spanking new vehicle  
 We recently purchased a new Ford F 150 Super Crew for the reason that we wanted a truck  We looked at the Dodge Ram  the Dodge Dakota  and the Ford Ranger  The F 150 was the most comfortable and economically sized  When we decided to test drive  the ride was smooth and quiet  All controls were perfectly situated for an easy ride  That was when we decided that the F 150 was what we wanted  Since then  I have been more than happy with our purchase  We have taken it with us on long road trips and even had to sleep in it which made for an accurate night of sleep  I was impressed with the comfort I felt that the F 150 had made during the long drive  I highly recommend this truck  
 I bought my Mark VIII new in late 1992  when it first came out  with much fanfare  It was  and is  a beautiful car  and I traded my  86 Mark VII for it  The Mark VII was a good car  but suffered from some electrical problems and brake problems  I finally traded it when the entire dashboard lighting went out  and was told it would cost  300 to fix it So I bought the brand new  42 000 Mark VIII  with almost no discount A lot of money  but I was assured it was all new  and state of the art Initially  I loved it  but soon thereafter  I noticed a low whistling type noise from the rear end  which appeared only between about 30 and 40 miles per hour  Unfortunately  that s a very common speed around town  The dealer tried everything  and eventually  the factory reps came and looked at it  After about six months  they decided to put in a brand new drive shaft  to replace the original  which finally solved the problem As the car has aged  the only problems have been with the automatic transmission  and the air shocks  The transmission seemed always to have shift points that were right in the middle of the most common speeds  Eventually  the shifting problem led to a complete transmission overhaul at 90 000 miles  which was about  1 500 and not under warranty  Also  those wonderful air shocks have now been replaced at all four corners  at a price of about  300 each  plus the inflator  which was another  300 Compared with the Mark VII  the Mark VIII has a much larger trunk  better acceleration and much better gas mileage  average of 21 mpg for me with mixed highway city driving  But it still has some basic Lincoln problems  high depreciation cost  transmission and quality issues Nevertheless  it is still beautiful  and fast  and a great car for long trips  It loves to run all day  and let you out feeling relaxed and unstressed br br  
 Ok  ok  I saw this car and fell in love with it  I think that is one of the first things that people tell you NOT to do when you are on a new car lot  To be completely honest  when I was on the lot  I had NO intent of buying anything  I was just there waiting for an oil change on my XT6  However  I have wanted an Impreza 2 5RS since they first hit the markets here in the US in  98  I was a bit hesitant at the time to buy one but  throwing caution to the wind I bought it and I can honestly say that I don t regret it one bit As far as the love hate relationship with vehicle  here s what I have so far  Love wise  I must say that this is a FUN car to drive  Especially if you can drive a 5 speed  I did have the opportunity to drive the automatic and prefer the 5 speed  It has a lot of low end torque for  get up and go  as well as enough speed to get away from you quickly if you don t watch out   I caught myself going about 95 down the local highway  didn t even notice it  This is a nice solid feeling vehicle  It feels quite safe in whatever weather is thrown at it  I have not had the opportunity to drive it in the snow yet  but if it handles anything like it does in every other situation I am sure that it will be great  This car feels like it has a hand holding it onto the road around corners  Everything is in logical positions ergonomicaly  I really didn t have to hunt for anything except the  parking light switch  because of the angle of the steering wheel I could not see it   However  having another Subaru I was able to locate it pretty easily  Gas milage seems pretty good too  I get about 22 27 Hate wise  I really can t think of anything that I would say that I HATE about this car  I do have a couple of things that would be nice to have different  though  First  I think the radio controls are a bit hard to reach and out of the way  you have to take your eyes off of the road pretty far to change the radio station  that  and the stereo is hard to get sounding right  I got the  tweeter kit  in mine and it almost makes it seem like you have too much treble or too little  Overall  I think this is a great vehicle for someone who wants a fun car to drive  but doesn t want some beheamoth that eats gas  This is more of a  practical fun  car  it s really sporty car but it won t leave you stuck off in a ditch or spinning all over the place in the winter time  The price is a little on the hefty side  MSRP of mine was about  21k  but I think it s worth it  if you are a bit more frugal you might want to check out the Impreza L  still a great car  Also  this is a great car if you want to be noticed  This is the first vehicle that I have owned that people who I don t know will stop me and comment on it     Hey guys  Women seem to LOVE this car   If you are going to be transporting people around quite frequently  though  you might want to opt for the Legacy  The back seats are fine for short trips but would probably be medieval torture if you had to be in them longer then 1 2 hour or so   especially if you are tall like me       
 Sport Utility Vehicles are a fixture on our roads  The combination of off road ability with people hauling capacity sells these trucks by the boatload  If you need to haul more than 5 or 6 people  though  your options are severely limited  The dreaded minivan is the most obvious ticket  or a station wagon with one of those rear facing third seats  The Chevy Suburban can carry up to 9 people  but carries a hefty price tag these days  If you want a small ish package  three rows of seats and four wheel drive  the Dodge Durango fits the bill  We test drove a Durango SLT The exterior styling of the Durango is  based on the Dakota  mid size pickup truck  The basic design has been around since the mid 1990 s on the Dodge Ram full size pickup  and wears well over time  Aggressively bulged fenders and a sculpted hood give a nod to classic trucks of the 1950 s  yet look thoroughly modern  With aluminum wheels and beefy tires  there is no way the  Durango looks like  anything but  a truck b b Inside   the habitat looks good and  generally feels luxurious   The biggest detractor I found was the amount of hard plastic  The dashboard  door panels  center console and A pillar were all covered with cheap sounding hard plastic  It all seemed durable  but hard plastic will eventually squeak  and may become brittle from sunlight after several years  The  doors are wide  and allow easy access to the front and second rows of seats  although my five foot tall wife noted  they design it for a person about one inch taller than I am  Grab handles are located on the a pillar and above the back doors for passenger ingress egress  The third seat is a bit harder to get into  but the second row seats fold and flip forward very easily  and reveal a step  mostly just a flat spot on the floor  for passengers to climb in back The  power driver s seat on the SLT  model we tested was comfortable  cushy yet not La Z Boy like  Height and tilt adjustments were available  as was a manual recline   Adjustable lumbar support  was located in just the right spot for my back  The second seat accommodated my wife and our rear facing child seat easily  She reported an abundance of legroom  and was comfortable throughout our half hour or so test drive  Shoulder belts are available for all outboard occupants  but only a lap belt is in the center position  The lack of a center shoulder belt can be seen as a positive or a negative  depending on your need  We needed to cinch in our carseat  and the lap belt only restraint made it very easy to simply latch the belt  then reef the strap tight   no need to fuss with a locking clip The  third row of seats will accomodate two adults    for short rides  The seat bottom is very close to the floor and anyone who is 5 10  or taller  as I am  will find themselves  eating their knees  The cushioning is thin and the seat is flat   Children would love sitting there   as it seems to be miles away from Dad the Driver Cargo area is puny with all three rows of seats up  A week s  groceries will fit behind the third seat   The third row folds down in about 10 seconds  though  and provides a flat load floor which would accomodate a week s worth of luggage and or pet carriers  With both  2nd and 3rd rows folded  flat  two or three people  could camp in the back  of the Durango The SLT 4x4 we tested had Dodge s newer  4 7 liter V 8  engine  first introduced in the Jeep Grand Cherokee  It generates  235 hp and 295 ft lbs  of torque  and gas mileage is rated at  14 city 18 highway   Rumor has it that this motor actually gets better gas mileage than the 3 9 liter V 6 motor in the Dakota  The motor is matched to a  4 speed automatic  transmission with overdrive  and has a real two speed transfer case that provides  2wd  4wd and 4lo  ranges  with shift on the fly capability   Up to 55 mph  our salesman stated The  dashboard is well laid out   with a tachometer on the left and speedometer on the right  Gauges are the tried and true white on black analog type  very legible  Oil pressure  water temperature and voltage gauges are provided standard  HVAC controls are easy to reach and the rotary dials are easy to use  The radio is located in about the middle of the dash  and is harder to reach and use while driving  but does provide  actual knobs for volume and tuning    nice to have instead of a salad of pushbuttons  The model we tested also had a  separate rear AC unit   The combination of front and rear AC cooled the interior of the Durango quickly and effectively on the humid day we drove it The Durango  handles quite well in town   Manhole covers and potholes are barely felt through the large tires and long travel suspension  though the ride is more bouncy than most cars like a truck  but  a well damped truck   The SUV was very easy to place in the lane  and visibility was very good through the windows and mirrors it was easy to check for cars before lane changes  The 4 7 liter V 8 provides  quick acceleration  and crisp response  and returns a throaty exhaust note b In the curves   the Durango feels very stable and  well planted   I noticed no front end push to speak of  and body roll was actually very slight for the type of vehicle this is  The steering was rather numb and overboosted  though   I felt that it would be very easy to simply spin the wheel too far and get out of shape in 2wd  In 4wd  though  the steering felt better  and the  overboost  I d felt was counteracted by the increased resistance that driven front wheels create  At all times  though  the Durango felt secure and in control I didn t get to do much more than drive through a gravel park driveway to test the off road ability  The  suspension soaked up big chuckholes   very  well  though  I shifted into 4lo  which requires you to stop  put the transmission in neutral  then push the transfer case lever forward  and the difference was instant  Four low provided a cruising speed of about 20mph  and pronounced engine braking  I tried to spin the wheels on the loose gravel from a standstill in 4lo  and while I snapped the necks of everyone onboard  there wasn t even a hint of wheelspin On the freeway  the Durango is likewise very smooth and solid  Seventy five miles per hour is an easy speed to reach and hold  and the SUV is very easy to control at that speed  Given the ability to pay for the gas in an 18mpg vehicle this would be a really good vehicle to take on a long trip Which brings us to the price of entry  We tested a Durango  SLT 4x4   which had the 3rd row seat  rear AC  anti spin rear axle  roof rack  31  tires with 15  aluminum wheels  floormats and fender flares  and was listed for  about  31 300   You can get the Durango Sport for a bit less  the Durango SLT Plus for a bit more  and the Durango R T for more than the SLT Plus  As SUV s in general go  this is in the middle high price range  As SUV s with 3 rows of seats go  this is very reasonable  as a Suburban is about your only other choice  and can crest  40 grand very easily Overall  I feel that the Durango combines ruggedly original Dodge styling  gutsy V 8 power with V 6 gas mileage  confident handling  smooth ride  easily configurable seating  and capability to carry 8 people 9 with a front bench seat  for about  30 000  I like this SUV  but there are two things that give me pause  One is the fuel economy  which is an Achilles Heel for all SUV s by nature  The other is the  reliability  of Chrysler products  If your Durango has good karma  I think it will make you very happy  though Here s a note  though  When you ask your wife in the back seat if you should take the test drive loop that you usually take  and the salesman is along for the ride don t say  Should we do what we usually do  This is virtually guaranteed to scare the bejeezus out of an outnumbered salesman who is in a car with people he s never met before  and there was a leaden pause before  Todd  asked   Um  that doesn t involve pushing the salesman out and taking off  does it So if you re out there  Todd  I m really sorry about that  
 Our Saab is a turbo convertible with a 5 speed transmission  It has black paint and black canvas top with tan leather interior  We bought this handsome car as a long term investment and have not been disappointed  Our car has provided many years of extremely reliable service with absolutely no major mechanical breakdowns  This is not to say that the car has never seen the repair shop  To the contrary  our car is at the shop for every single prescribed maintenance service and also for the rare mechanical problem  We average 25 28 mpg with this car  and that is mostly freeway driving The most important thing a new or potential Saab owner should do is locate a GOOD  ask for some customer references  certified  independent mechanic  Our mechanic is not only reasonably priced  but he is honest and ethical  unlike the local dealership  He knows our cars and is familiar with their idiosyncrasies  Understand that your Saab will require a knowledgeable mechanic s regular maintenance  so find a mechanic you like and trust  This form of service relationship will reward you with hundreds of thousands of miles from a very fun to drive car AND save you thousands of dollars Our car looks and drives excellent  The quality of the interior finish is both excellent  seats  headliner  steering wheel and switches are all excellent  and poor  door panel fabric  vinyl glove box door  dash trim could have been better quality  Overall  our interior has held up well  The convertible top mechanism operates smoothly and quietly as it should  amazing for the age of the vehicle  If you buy a convertible  keep in mind that a new top will run about  600 1 100 installed  for an OEM top price depends on how much of the top you replace  We just replaced our entire top for the first time  and because we plan on keeping our Saab for many more years we decided on an OEM part since the original top had proven its durability to us  Our car s black paint still holds a deep shine  although we did have the front bumper repainted at 100 000 miles due to light oxidation on the gray paint  Unknowing people think our 14 year old Saab is just a couple years old  The exterior has held up very well  Major repairs to date  front suspension overhaul including driver s side upper and lower control arm  this was expensive  shocks  complete valve re grind  we did this while the head was off to replace the main gasket seal which was leaking  replace all vacuum lines  very inexpensive and quick preventative vacuum leak fix  water pump with thermostat and hoses  Clutch  only once so far and it is wasn t very expensive  Front rotors at 120 000 miles  Repair Summary  We haven t had a loan payment on this car in years  so I don t consider an average annual investment of one hundred to two hundred dollars in maintenance and repair to be excessive  I can recommend purchasing a Saab like ours without hesitation  however I would certainly be sure to review the car s maintenance history and speak to the mechanic who regularly serviced the car  Watch out for poorly maintained vehicles  as they ll likely cost a bundle to fix properly  Have your potential  new  Saab looked over by your newfound local mechanic  after all  he s going to be working on it in the future  Be careful when buying a used auto transmission car as I have been told that the transmissions are expensive to repair replace and do not offer the life expectancy of a manual  I have never owned a Saab with an auto transmission  so this is secondhand information  
 I bought my swift in April 2000  This car is fantastic We bought a 5 speed manual shift  gray in color I highly recommend this car  The fuel mileage is out of this world  I have changed the oil already 2 times since we bought it  As far as roominess  not much but we knew that before I gave them the money  It will seat 4 comfortably  Dont try 5  On long trips  we remained comfortable  The only thing that I found wrong with this car is that when you are running the air conditioner  dont plan on going very fast because of the pull this ac has  it boggs down the engine  The hatchback is extremely convenient as you dont have to throw all your groceries in the backseat  My girlfriend refers to this car as the  quot Giant Egg quot  Its not a bad thing  The Stereo is a am fm cassette and has very good sound for being a factory install  Here is the best thing As we are going through the high prices of gasoline  it only costs  12 00 to fill this car up with premium unleaded fuel  With all the driving I do back and forth it makes it very affordable  Buy this car  You wont regret it br br  
 Audi A8  2003 Superb Luxury I conclude my revision of the Audi 146s with the A8  The A8 is the top end for this automaker  I wanted the A8 to be like the icing on the cake so I planned that I would test drive it last So far I really enjoyed all the Audis I reviewed  they are well engineered and the workmanship in these car is excellent PRODUCT DESCRIPTION The Audi A8 is their luxury automobile  there are two types of A8  The basic and the A8L  the L stands for the extended version of the basic model and you would be looking at an extra  6 000 00 to be able to stretch your feet a few extra inches The model I test drove is the basic A8 so I will concentrate on that one for the rest of this review Because of the A8 has an extended list of safety standard features plus an aluminum body panels and its resistance in crashes  it received a five stars safety rating from the National Highway Transportation Safety Association  THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR The interior Probably the hardest you will have to do if you decide to purchase an Audi A8  will be to decide on the color of your leather seats  there are six different colors to select from  Once you have past this task the rest is easy since just about everything else come as standard equipment I always enjoy smelling the leather in a new car and as soon as I opened the driver 146s door I got a good sniff of very fine quality leather in the A8  I took place behind the steering wheel  adjusted the power seat to a position I was comfortable and enjoyed the moment for a while  The demo I was to test drive had less than 100 miles on the odometer  this one was of the floor room The all around view from the driver 146s seat is excellent  I really liked the oversize side view mirrors  They give you an excellent view of on coming traffic with a minimal dead spot  The list of standard luxury equipment is very long  I will start with Air conditioning  a multi functional steering wheel with control for the audio system  telephone and the Tiptronic transmission  front passenger memory seat  power windows  power locks  power mirrors  cruise control  tilt steering  leather and heated seats  AM FM cassette radio player with a CD player  sunroof rear defrost and alloy wheels All these top quality features make for riding in an A8 a real pleasure If there is only one weakness with the interior of the A8 is the tight space  for a luxury car one would expect a little more headroom and legroom in the front and the back  Maybe those few extra inches in the L version would be worth it then The exterior From the exterior the Audi A8 is a beautiful automobile to look at  one can see the luxury and smooth ride you will have almost by just looking at it  I could not find a single flaw with the exterior body of the A8 The trunk space is very generous at 18 cubic feet of volume TECHNICAL INFORMATION The Audi A8 I test drove had under the hood Engine  A 4 2 liters  V 8 engine developing 310 horsepower at 6200 RPM Transmission  A 5 speed automatic Tiptronic transmission Brakes  All wheel disc brakes with ABS Tires  225 60R16 Safety  Driver and passenger airbags  Side airbags  Traction control  Child safety locks  Keyless remote entry PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I drive many cars and sometime I drive automobiles  The Audi A8 is one of the finest automobiles I had the opportunity to drive in a long time  It is a great ride on the highway and an easy drive within city limits  
 Although The explorer s design is showing age from it s extensive re modeling in 94  the Explorer continues to be a reliable and dependable truck for the long haul  fun  or the short commute  It also continues to be the best selling SUV in america  Overall fit and finish and quality all round is well done  Only minor glitches like a broken sensor or a bad winsheild wiper  All repairs were fixed free of charge  On my explorer we purchased the Eddie Bauer package which included signature leather seats and additional brand name extras  The upgrade though expensive to me was well worth it  Along with our explorer we purcahsed the premium JBL Stereo system with the powered sub woofer in the rear  The quality of the system is far more than one would expect out of a usual factory installed sytem  To tow our boat s we purchased the towing package which was expensive for what it was  we found it to be cheaper to go to U Haul and install it cheaper  For harsh winters we also purchased the 4x4 package which boosted the price yet another grand  honestly we have never used the 4x4 because we found the traction on the explorer to be adequete enough for the harsh winters we experience in illinois  If you are planning on doing some heavy off roading which very few people do in their  30 000 suv then buy it otherwise it is just an extra that baloons the price alot  Engine choices were between an SOHC V 6 or a regular V 8  after doing my research I found the SOHC only lacked 10 horsepower from the V 8 and was alot cheaper  If you are thinking about buying an explorer in the near future I would suggest the Eddie Bauer Package if you can afford it  Go for the SOHC V 6 unless you are deadset on the V 8  Completely avoid the 4x4 unless you really plan on using it  And always shop around we bought our explorer about  4 000 less than the sticker price because of all sort s of year end deals and rebates from the factories on certain model s  The Explorer is a dependable  safe  and fun to drive car br br  
 In 1999 Ford came out with their latest body style mustang  They improved the overall appearance of the car as well as the power underneath the hood Ford did a great job on the newest incarnation of an already classic American musclecar  The newest Mustang sports a few more boxy edges than it s predecessor as well as flared fenders and a new spoiler They improved the popular base 3 8 V6 Mustang from 150 HP in 1998 to 190 HP in  99  This much improved car actually gives it some get up and go  The standard 5 spd manual is a bit of a reach when going for some gears  but overall a good fit  The optional automatic suffers some parasitic loss transferring the power to the rear wheels Overall this is a great car with a meaner look and a quality engine underneath it s hood  
 With home ownership comes a whole new set of necessary items to buy and errands to run  but until late October we d been able to use one or the other of our sedans for everything we needed   you  can  fit a 12  roll of carpet into a Volvo sedan  by the way Then in late October  three things happened  We bought a D I Y shed in a box  we had a windstorm  and our half finished shed was turned into scrap steel  We needed to take it back to Home Depot  but there was no way the remains were going to fit in our car  We needed to rent a truck We considered renting a U Haul  but after figuring mileage charges decided to rent a pickup truck from a  normal  car rental place  When we arrived at Budget rent a car  the F150 we wanted was still out  so they rented us a dark blue  2001 Expedition XLT b The SUV was moderately loaded with a package that included a 6 way power driver s seat  auto dimming mirror  power b adjustable pedals b  power windows  mirrors and locks  lighted running boards and a 3rd row seat  It also had aluminum wheels and meaty tires  and the upgraded 5 4 liter  Triton  V8 engine First  driving impression  was that it drove  smaller  than it actually was  I found it  quite easy  to crank it out of the tight rental parking lot at the airport  Second impression was that the thing was  powerful i  The first three takeoffs I made snapped my head back until I learned the right amount of throttle to give it Overall  the Expedition was easy to pilot on the open road  The truck platform it s based on was  sprung a bit softer  and wasn t as  boingy  as a pickup  This SUV is fairly heavy  and wasn t affected much by crosswinds  either  The steering was good for a vehicle its size  and I found it exceedingly easy to keep it in my lane   actually  now I wonder why so many of these things seem to be wandering over centerlines I don t know what the base 4 6 liter motor is like in an Expedition  but if you can stomach getting  14 miles per gallon b  I d recommend upgrading to the  5 4 liter Triton  engine  The thing has  guts i  In some cars you have to  give it some gas  or  depress the accelerator  With other cars you can  punch it  or  drop the hammer I  dropped the hammer  a couple of times  and found that  roll on acceleration  from 50 mph to 75 mph or so was  really rapid b  The automatic transmission was exceptionally smooth while doing it  as well Once I got home  I opened the liftgate and removed the  3rd seat b  The removal process was easy  but the seat itself is bulky and  heavy    carrying it is a job for two people or one person with a strong back  The 2nd seat folded down and almost flat with virtually no effort  leaving an  8 foot deep cargo area  to the back of the front seats  I was able to toss the mostly disassembled dead shed into the back of the Expedition with plenty of room left over   in fact  I only needed to fold down the  60  part of the 60 40 fold down second row seat After returning from Home Depot  my 5 0  wife climbed in  and declared it easy due to the running board and multitude of grab handles  We then went up our road  which is dirt  and had been soup ified by a solid week of rain  The Expedition  forged through foot deep ruts  in the mud with only a touch of squirrelyness with the electric 4x4 selector in the  AWD  setting  Turning it to  4Hi  removed any trace of instability  and my wife had fun sending muddy water flying up onto the windshield We traded places and I pointed the SUV down a familiar two track  Again  the Expedition drove  smaller  than it actually is   Visibility is excellent b  and I was able to place the wheels where I needed them on the trail  The Triton motor pulled the heavy SUV through an unexpectedly deep  but probably not over the hubs  waterhole without hesitation  The gutsier I got  the more fun I had  Let s just sum it up by saying that I achieved my goal of getting  mud on the roof b The next morning we picked up two friends of ours and went out to breakfast in our dirty rental Expedition   you so rarely see them dirty  you know  The SUV held myself  my wife  my 18 month old son in his carseat  my 6 4  friend and his SO  with plenty of shoulder and leg room for all  and we didn t even use the 3rd seat Summing up  the Expedition was easy to steer in a parking lot  easy to drive on the open road  easy to drive on a two track  grin inspiringly powerful  cavernous inside  and got abysmally bad gas mileage  
 I bought a used SC2 in October  96 and in January  97 I was T boned in the driver s door on an icy interstate  My head broke the driver s window  fortunately I was wearing a baseball cap that I found lots of glass shards in later  The speaker popped out of the door and hit my ankle pretty hard  I was left sitting across the interstate  hoping someone wouldn t hit the passenger door too  Other than a sore ankle and a stiff neck  I walked away unharmed  I am soooooo glad that I had the steel safety cage that Saturn promotes  The body shop said that the whole frame was sprung  meaning the whole frame had been shifted to the right  about 4 inches judging by the dash  It was totaled  I took pictures and took it back to the dealership with me  everyone was impressed that I walked away from that I turned right around and bought another SC2  This time it was brand new instead of used  not that I got a lot of insurance money I was lucky to not have to pay anything  they tried to make ME pay  600  we fought to come out as even  Anyway  I went right back to Saturn I was first impressed with the Saturn dealers the first time I walked on the lot  I was looking at the new ones  just for future reference  A salesman asked to help us  Dad said that we were just looking and not going to buy anything today  much less new  Bob  the salesman  asked if we were familiar with Saturn  When we weren t he offered to show us around  knowing full well we weren t buying today  When I decided on Saturn  he even helped us with the used car  even though he was a new car salesmen  I like the no haggle way of buying  and the salespeople are very nice  Two years later  Bob still recognized me as one of his customers  The lease is up in a couple of months and I plan to get a 3 door coupe  My friends will appreciate this when more than one goes with me to lunch at work  LOL I love the looks of my Saturn  the  97 body style  The only drawback is the lack of legroom in back  There is a lot more room up front with the new style where the coupe is on the sedan frame  The power is also a little less than I would like  But I ve learned how to work around it  even with an automatic  I can beat nearly anyone I want when leaving a stoplight or merging with traffic       
 As a student  my financial situation has always been the main factor in my purchase of automobiles  After extensive searching  I finally decided to go with something made by the relatively new General Motors company of Saturn  I looked and drove practically every model of Saturn out there today  I decided on the 1995 SL2 model  It is larger than the SC models  yet sportier and more nimble than the SW wagons  For those that don t know  the SL2 has a DOHC 16v 1 9 liter engine  The extra cam is most helpful while passing or accelerating at speeds of 40 to 70 mph  Living in California  I have been driving my Saturn at freeway speeds of between 75 and 90 mph  and it handles magnificently  The only drawback I have noticed about this car is that with the smaller engine  operation of the air conditioner draws significant power from the car  however  the trade off is constant 35 mpg economy  I have never had any serious problems with it  It is very low maintenance  and replacement parts are very common since Saturn has stuck with basically two different designs in the past 10 years  I would recommend this car to any student  or even as a first car for anyone  The car retains its value very well  and is fun to drive     
 I use my jeep for Search  amp  Rescue  I have been on a Search  amp  Rescue team here in Ohio since 1992  I have used it to get into hard to reach places for searches and once to haul a found subject out to civilization  My Jeep s have never failed me  I am driving my fifth Jeep Cherokee  I guess you could say I am hooked  I started with a used full size monster 1979 Cherokee with a 401 cubic inch motor  I really liked it  but I got gallons to the mile with that one  After that I started with the scaled down size Cherokees and my last three have been Sport models with the 4 0L six cylinder engine  I haven t had any problems with power especially with my latest 1997 one that has fuel injection  They have served my needs well to haul what I want and to go where I want  If you have a large family I wouldn t really recommend it unless you like being really close  If you have to haul large items like building materials or a boat or canoe then you will need the roof rack  Also I highly recommend the rear window wiper washer  The first downsized one I bought had a problem with the seat back breaking twice  However that hasn t been an issue in the last three  I haven t really had any other major problems and hope I don t  Murphy you aren t listening are you  Sorry  I couldn t resist br br  
 If your looking for something along the lines of a Nissan Altima or Toyota Camray but don t want to pay the high price  the Ford Contour might just be the vehicle for you  We purchased a 99 Countour this spring and have been quite happy with it  The price was approximately  15 700 complete with full power package  A C  AM FM Cassette and Manual Transmission  with Ford financing at 5 9  Financing  In our Case the primary reason for purchasing this vehicle was that we needed a vehicle that was reliable and comfortable enough to seat a family of Two adults and three children ages 3  8 and 9  which means a Car Seat or Booster seat in the back  Of course Cost was a major consideration also  and the price definitely fit the budget better than several other vehicles in the same class with about the same options  Our previous vehicle was a 95 Nissan Altima and the transition from the Altima to the Contour was more like going between different model years rather than make and model  they were that similar  The handling on both vehicles was not rough  but felt more sporty than sedan like  Likewise the comfort level is quite pleasant  but again a little more sporty feel than something along the lines of a Taurus  In fact the biggest noticable difference between the two models is that the Contour does not have quite the horspower and acceleration as it s Japanese counterparts  Don t get me wrong  the contour is not underpowered by any means  but if your used to the abundance of torque available in most of the Japanese models it may take a little getting used to  Actually  it really seems as though I never switched vehicles  and I have only one thing about the vehicle that I personnally dislike and that is the lack of a good place to put a oversized travel mug  All things considered that statement says a lot  as if all I can say bad is the common drink holder dilema then I think that pretty much anyone who has been buying the middle of the road Japanese compacts such as Camrays  Altima s or Galant would do well to take a look at the Contour  For price  Functionality and drivability it s definitely a contendor br br  
 After an unfortunate incident that lead to the demise of my previous car  I needed a cheap  economical car for my 80 mile commute  I found what I was looking for on the Ford dealer s lot   amazing since it was a vehicle loaded with all the options except an automatic  very rare in the North East The vehicles is actually very decent for what you pay  The plastics on the interior are soft  unlike most American economy cars  and the interior is fairly well constructed  I wasn t expecting too much room in a small two door car  but at 6 2  I do not have to set the seat at the end of the tract meaning that the car would be reasonably comfortable for a taller person  My car came with the two tone sport interior which is very attractive  The seats are comfortable for medium distances  but the lack of a driver s armrest prohibits long journeys The exterior is attractive  but a tad  girly  The lights have good range and brightness and the fog lights really help in poor weather conditions  Another nice feature is the gas strut trunk lid  a feature that many cars costing 2x 3x more don t have  One gripe is the 15  wheels look small  even though they really aren t Driving the car is a pleasure  The 5 speed shifts very nicely and the clutch allows smooth starts  On the highway  the engine is running around 3500rpm at 75mph  so it does get loud  but any speed under 70 the car is very quiet  The engine also has enough power to light the tires all the way through first  on the one two shift  and if you have enough room sometimes the two three shift  And this is with getting roughly 30 32mpg in combined 30  city 70  highway Overall  a very nice car for not much money  
 Man  what I year I ve had  I ve had to make sacrifices and compromises I never thought I would  I finally got some bucks back and the first area I was going to  un compromise  was my car  I had been driving an 89 V 6 Firebird  It was a great little car  and yes  I reviewed it  I could have stuck with it  I liked it enough  However  having the means  I decided to get my V 8 back  I thought it was going to be in the form of a used Camaro Z 28  but this Trans Am caught my eye  It was a 1998 chameleon blue beauty that just had my name written all over it  I had seen this color before and I knew it was hard to come by  This is an iridescent color that is metallic jade green in the sun and metallic blue in the shade  In between it turns about a dozen different shades of deep aqua  In short  it s gorgeous GM use to be known for their fit and finish problems  They have more than redeemed themselves  I ve seen the finishes on a lot of cars and this one is darn near perfect  I swear  it is smooth and flat and glossy and wonderful  The interior is a dark gray leather and vinyl  Beautiful chrome wheels and low profile Good Year tires finish the look I ve read most of the reviews of the Trans Am and Camaro cars and I feel they have been slighted by many  There isn t much middle ground  that s for sure  People either love or hate them  and I reckon that s a good thing  An old fashioned American muscle car should be a wishy washy subject I m going to give you the details I didn t like first and hopefully finish on a high note  Lots of folks gripe about hardware details  The power seat switch and the multi function turn signal are favorites for GM bashers  Yes  they could be modernized  The turn signal looks rather dated when viewed with the very modern instrument panel  The fact is this thing works  I ve seen my share of really futuristic looking ones that are specially designed for a specific model car  Here are the drawbacks to those  You have to re learn the location every time you drive a different car  That special design also costs a lot more than you would think  GM put those bucks into motor and drive train development  If you want a performance car and you want a reasonable price tag  you want the car maker to do things like that The fastest and most uncomfortable car I ever had the privilege of driving was a Ferrari 30 GTB   think Magnum PI  It was a really sweet machine but I wouldn t drive it everyday  and I can t afford one  The Trans Am is in the same performance envelope  but you can use it as your daily driver  The Trans Am is very comfortable and the front seats are quite roomy  The back seat is the same as it has been since the late 70 s  small  Great for young kids or short trips for adults and that s about it Let s talk a bit about that much maligned lump on the driver s side  Look  the catalytic converter had to go somewhere  There is considerably more than aesthetics involved when placing such a critical component  OK  if performance isn t paramount  you can stick the thing almost anywhere  The Trans Am is a performance car and the exhaust system is an integral part of the whole package  A marathon runner wouldn t be expected to breathe through a soda straw  So you can t expect performance cars to have a restrictive or poorly designed exhaust system I ve ridden in the passenger seat  When you re in the car  you don t know the lump is there  I think what some people  particularly women  object to is the  legs out  position that most of these type cars require  Ever sit in a Porsche  Your calves rub the floor mats  Same with the Corvette  This is a car  not a lounge chair  Just move your seat forward a bit and your knees come up and the problem is solved OK  now the good stuff  GM is going to  supposedly  kill the Firebird and Camaro off in 2002  Of course they are  it s just about perfect  Remember the Fiero GT  Just when they get it looking and performing like it should they kill it  The last year Fiero GT s are wonderful sports cars and I believe will prove to be the sleeper of the decade  If I hadn t needed a back seat for my two little ones  I would have found one The Firebird in Trans Am trim has incredible power and handling  This thing is just a hoot to fling around  It will do pretty much anything you want except evade radar  It gets very good gas mileage as well  Even with a fair amount of aggressive driving  I get 19 mpg around town  A steady 80 mph on the interstate will yield a whopping 28 mpg I made sure I got the 6 speed manual  I hereby nominate this transmission for the automobile hall of fame  It is that good  5th and 6th are both overdrive  80 mph is exactly 2 grand on the tach  Remarkable  I could live without the  skipshift  feature though  For those of you unfamiliar with this transmission  when you drive economically  it gates you from 1st to 4th  You skip 2nd and 3rd  The motor has more than enough torque to pull it off  it just feels a little unnatural  Brisk acceleration  or a slight pause between 1st and 2nd opens the gate and shifting is normal As for gauges  accessories et al  they are plentiful and very well positioned  Driving is a pleasure and the car doesn t demand a lot of your attention in order to drive it  You can focus on the road like you re supposed to  The Monsoon stereo is excellent  I can t for the life of me figure out why someone would want to replace it  People do  and I guess it s a matter of taste  As an electronic engineer and a bit of an audiophile  I can tell you that it is very hard and very expensive to do better that the factory stereo in the Trans Am All in all  I love this car  I got my V 8 back  and it is a pleasure to drive  I love the styling on the Trans Am  Previously I detested the  Batmobile  style nose  The current body style is just right  Wonderfully curvaceous  but everything looks like it serves a purpose  If you re in the market for performance and you truly understand what a performance car is  then you would do well to give the Trans Am a look  A good long one  
 There are definitely some great advantages of being related to my father  Not only did I inherit his good looks  and his ability to tell a fine story  but I also get FORDS  and any other division like Jaguar  for really cheap You see my father was a Ford engineer for 25 years  So  okay I am a little bias  Regardless  the fact that he is now retired from Ford  allows me to get brand new cars at the  quot Z quot  price  This is a price that is actually below the price a dealer pays for a vehicle  So naturally  I buy all Fords In 1996 I bought my first brand new car of my life  at  quot Z quot  price of course  It was scary but thrilling  I have 3 children and so I had decided I needed a mini van  I walked on the lot and immediately fell in love with the Windstar  It has a classy look  handles great and has plenty of space  I went with the Windstar instead of the Astrovan because of the chassis  The Astrovan has a truck chassis  while Windstar has a car chassis  This is why you hear owners of the Windstar talk about how well it handles  Now  I have to say I bought my Windstar in a very controversial year for the vehicle  A lot of owners of 95 and 96 Windstars have had major problems  most that are covered under warranty  The problem I find with most car owners is they don t know how to fight for their rights to make a dealership honor a warranty  My best advice is  if a dealer does not cooperate take your Ford to another dealer to fix it  You do not have to have your vehicle fixed at the dealer you bought it from  If that doesn t work  YELL  SCREAM  SHOUT  A squeaky wheel gets the grease you know Now  I personally have not had one problem with my Windstar  My dealership  and another dealership here in Wichita fight for my affection  Needless to say  I am now buying my second  quot new car quot  We will soon be the proud owners of a 2000 Ford F350 dually crew cab  Powerstroke diesel of course About the only thing I can say about my Windstar that may be a little negative is it s fuel tank is like 25 gallons  But  who cares when you get the kind of mileage I get  Oh yeah one more thing I should mention is the windshield hisses  or whistles  at certain speeds above 50  However  after further research I found this is true in MANY Fords  I have read up on this quite a bit  and have found that no one knows why  There are some funny ways people try to fix this  I personally don t hear it that often so therefore  I do not mess with it Now  my next car is going to be the new Windstar with keyless entry  duel sliding doors and some conversions  I ll let you know what I think  Until then Agent99 br br  
 I have owned my 2000 cat for over a yr now and have had no problems whatsoever  Living in Pennsylvania  we are notorious for our less then Christmas scene winters  And the terrain  well  its not something you want to drive a low profile vehicle on too long  I have been a cougar owner for years and this new front wheel drive and totally changed styling was something I was a little wary about at first but once I drove it around I won t go back  It handles turns that are recommended speeds of 30 at 75  although I am not saying go do it  but the grip  and handling of this car is astounding  Even though it may be considered a performance car  it handles our rough winters like a true cat extending its claws into the road and digging in  I have also discovered from previous cars I owned that this one has got to be one of the easiest to customize  The plastic interior panels are snapped in instead of those pesky hidden screws you can t reach and are very easy to remove to run wires behind or such  As mentioned above  the only thing I find wrong is a very deep ashtray that your cigarette will fall into and you basically have to remove the ashtray to retrieve it  But hey with the power windows  thats why you roll it down an inch and flick it out onto the windshield of the guy wanting to be in the car with you only 3 inches from your bumper  But if you like performance and handling in a car  that will be unlikely  even with the automatic transmission you have the power to get up and go  Like I stated earlier  the new design of this cougar compared to the older more family oriented ones of the past  I would recommend that this not be the family car of choice  The rear seats are a little small and are basically factory child seats  People over 5  6  would have a stiff neck riding in the rear seats from leaning their head sideways  But all in all  think about it  how many 2 door cars now a days are supposed to be a family sedan anyway  I mean ever see more than 3 people in a Corvette  Same here  two doors   2 people  Unless you have small kids  On to the exterior  The cute little grill up front placed between the eerie looking smoked  cat eyes  headlights  gives it that intimidating get out of my way look instead of that happy smiling face on the Neon or something  I mean which would you move for if you looked in your rearview  Although the rear of the car could have been made sportier  it fits in with the overall layout of the car  and comes down to one word aerodynamic  It cuts through the air like a wedge  hence the term wedge design  Every aspect of the car is rounded and there are no square or pointed edges on it anywhere giving it a true performance feel in a 70 MPH headwind  It is great on gas mileage as well  I have made a 650 mile trip and only filled up once  of course I wasn t going granny speed either So in conclusion  if you are single or have no or small children and looking for an affordable  powerful  eye catcher that handles great with the safety of your passengers in mind and for yourself  no foreign car for the price will do  The only thing that upsets me about it is this is the last year they are making the long running Cougar and to Mercury  I state good car  bad business decision  UPDATE 6 28 03  I have recently did a major overhaul on this  Added custom chrome wheels  cat back dual exhaust  injen intake  bosch platinum 4 spark plugs  turbocharger  and a viper performance chip  All this was very simple to add and install by myself  which would make what I said about customizing this car even easier than previously stated  It s amazing how much power can actually be gained from this little V6  which when tested now I get 310 HP at the wheels  So for any of you wanting a nice car which is also easily performance upgradable  this is your car  I mean we true devoted cougar owners dont need some stupid movie  fast and furious  to copy our cars from and think we are cool  I mean think about it  if not for that movie  how many of these young punks would actually waste their money customizing these pieces of crap imports  or even buy one  Sorry but I am American therefore  I am gonna BUY American  By the way  anyone with these imported pieces of crap you think is sooooooo cool and bad  Anytime  Anywhere  pink slip for pink slip just like the movie at least that part of the movie you WON T want to copy now will you  
 In December of 1995 I bought a new 1996 Eagle Talon TSi  Turbocharged  I loved the car and there s nothing like the sudden rush of power you get from a turbocharged engine  Nevertheless  I got the new car bug and started researching the BMWs  The problem  fully dressed out  the 3 series BMW I wanted would cost  40 000 plus  so I started checking out comparables on the internet  When I researched the Acura TL Type S  the styling didn t particularly appeal to me  but the 260 HP rating did  Within two weeks of beginning my research  I was driving home a black Types S with Ebony interior  I ve had it about a week and a half and thought I d share my thoughts  By the way  one day after I bought it  I was in the foothills of the Appalachian s speeding through some S turns  My unit does not have the navigation system  My superior male sense of direction  coupled with an up to date Rand McNally  along with my willingness to stop and ask for directions on an as needed basis  saved me two grand The extras I purchased included locking wheel nuts  trunk tray  and nose cover  As to the exterior  Internet pictures do not do the car justice  Although the back end is somewhat bland  the aggressive front end treatment provides a pleasing balance  I declined the dealer installed spoiler  No complaints about the plastics used in the interior  I knew what I was getting when I bought it  remember  this unit was about  10 000 than the BMW   you get what you pay for  The leather seats are comfortable  The eight position driver s seat has two memory settings  Unlocking the car with the remote transmitters also sets the memory positions for the driver s seat and the outside mirrors  mine sets my position and my wife s sets hers  The front seats have two heat settings  but I live in the Deep South and don t expect to get much use from them  There are two power outlets  one where you would expect the cigarette lighter to be in the dash and one in the second  lower  compartment in the center console  The leather covered armrest on the center console adjusts forward and back but not up and down  There is plenty of interior cabin space for my wife  our five year old  and me  Trunk space is more than adequate I ve read some complaints about the lack of a manual transmission  But my wife can t drive a stick  Besides  after six years of driving a five speed Talon  I was ready for an automatic  The Type S has a five speed automatic with a Sport Shift mode  When in D5  simply move the shift lever to the left and you have some control over shift points  I say some control because you have no control over the shift points between first and second  However  to shift into third  push forward on the stick and the car shifts smoothly into third  the same for fourth and fifth  Pulling back on the shifter reverses the process  All shifts are smooth  I emphasize smooth because I ve read at least one review that said the shifts were abrupt  I disagree and would not mind if the shifts were a little more on the  abrupt  side The car has Vehicle Stability Assist  I must not toss it around hard enough because I haven t noticed The VSA kicking in  In any event  if it activates when you don t want it to  you can use a button on the dash to shut it off It comes with Michelin Pilot MXM4 215 50R 17 tires  I experienced good adhesion in S turns on dry  hot pavement  The steering is not as quick as I was used to in the Talon  but is still quick  especially for a mid sized car  My one gripe is that the steering feels somewhat heavy  especially at slow speed  I noticed this when I did the test drive and commented on it to the salesman   a minor annoyance and not a deal killer During straight ahead acceleration  I experience little if any torque steer  However  torque steer is somewhat noticeable if turning the wheels during acceleration in first gear  This is similar to what I experienced with the Talon  210 HP out of a 2 liter engine  also a FWD  I suppose that s the price you pay for a FWD vehicle with a lot of ponies  As to the acceleration itself  this car is quick  I doubt I ll ever find out if the 160 mph shown on the speedometer is really attainable  so I don t know how FAST it is  But I can attest to the fact that  for a normally aspirated engine fed through an automatic transmission  it is quick  A quick punch to the accelator from a standing start will make the front tires bark  I ll never make it to the track to time it  but I ve read in more than one publication that it will get to 60 mph in the mid 6 s and do the quarter mile in about 15 seconds   about as quick as the turbocharged Talon  Mind you that the power band in the Type S is broader  you don t have that turbo rush  and you don t get off the line like you would with a five speed  Nonetheless  with the overall smoothness and quietness of the car  you don t realize that you ve accelerated to the far side of 80 mph until you 1  notice you are passing everybody on the Interstate  or 2  take a look at the speedometer The Type S comes with sport suspension  The big question  is it harsh  I must first qualify my answer by saying that I have a bias toward a stiff ride  I am comfortable feeling what the road is telling me  So  is the ride harsh  Compared to the sport suspension of the Talon  it s like riding on a cloud  A stiffer suspension wouldn t bother me  If I get around to it  I might invest in some stiffer springs and beefier anti sway bar  but that remains to be seen  Is the ride acceptable  Absolutely  It s smooth  quiet  much quieter than the Talon  and evokes a feeling of confidence in turns and curves  All in all  not a bad ride for a  31 000 four door family sedan Other features  The brightest headlights I ve ever seen  cold air conditioning  excellent sound system  in dash 6 CD changer  with steering wheel mounted controls  side air bags  heated outside mirrors  haven t had a chance to test them  four cup holders  two front that won t accept two biggie drinks at once  two in pull down center armrest in rear  coin holder  and a rock steady cruise control  Braking instills confidence  huge front discs  and five spoke 17  wheels  look good and easy to wash  The steering wheel adjusts up and down but not in and out  The metallic gauges look good  are easy to read  and look cool at night  The moon roof is standard and will be used only rarely  I m not a moon roof kind of guy Am I glad I bought it  After two weeks and over 1200 miles  the verdict is not yet in  but all indications are that I have a winner  
 I just purchased a 2002 Ford Explorer Sport and must admit that despite some significant improvements  I am disappointed  I leased a 1999 Ford Explorer Sport for three years  I leased it because I was concerned that moving from a small sports car  I would not adapt well to the bigger SUV  My concern was misplaced   I fell in love with my SUV  Had it not been for the lease  I d have kept that 1999 Sport  But it made more sense financially to buy a new one  So this review accentuates the difference between the previous Ford Explorers and the new one The Good My new Explorer is good  the suspension has been re designed and the ride is improved  getting rid of the  hobby horse  ride that afflicted the old Explorer Sport  Steering is much improved as well  and this Explorer Sport feels less top heavy and better grounded than previous ones  BTW  the tires are Goodyear ATs  Road noise is minimized  The new design is less  trucky  than the previous design   although I like that big honking truck look  The Audiophile sound system  and especially the DSP is fantastic  although I wish they could have accommodated cassette tapes  am I dating myself  The SUV still has that solid  substantial feel of previous Explorer Sports  an attribute that is sadly lacking in the Ford Escape  which I also considered  Overall  the fit and finish are good  with good quality materials used appropriately  The interior is more streamlined  not unlike the Jeep Liberty  but not as  edgy    the simulated brushed metal center panel and door pulls are a nice touch  There are still plenty of pockets  nooks and crannies for personal items  The Bad But there are a few things that have dampened my enthusiasm  Head room is noticeably less  although my new sunroof exacerbates this  I m only 5 3  and I usually don t even notice head room issues  In the new Explorer  I do  I miss having lighted vanity mirrors and I wish the car had been available in black instead of the red I settled on  but those are really minor points  The Ugly What I really miss is the autolamp feature  which I had thought was part of the premium package  I did not realize how much I would miss this feature but  to my surprise  I have realized that it is not just a convenience feature  it is a safety feature  Having the headlights stay on while I walked to my door and found my house key and let myself into the house was very reassuring  It also prevents my leaving the lights on and returning to a dead battery   another safety issue for me  Autolamps are generally included in cars at this price point  and are included in the other Explorer models  and I feel a little cheated not having this valuable option that I did have on my old Explorer  The other really annoying feature is the seats  The fact that the seats don t revert to their previous position when pushed forward to allow someone in or out is really a pain  More than a pain  they are a safety hazard  Because of the airbags  my niece rides in the back seat  When she gets out on the passenger side  the seat stays in a position that blocks my view out the passenger window  I have to reach over and under the front seat to push it back and then reach over to the seat lever to get the seat back into a safe position  My old Mazda had a better system than this and Ford really ought to work on this  To move the seat back into position requires two hands  a real pain  While acceleration is good  the steering is still too clumsy and the Explorer leans ominously on turns  And the rear wheels have a tendency to pull out to the left or right when you hit a pothole or bump  even at speeds as low as 30 mph  This combination makes for a very uncertain feel in maneuvering The Ford Explorer Sport does not have  even as options  many of the more luxurious features found in the other Explorer trim lines  Although leather seating is available  heated seats  or as my niece calls them   butt warmers  are not  Neither is automatic temperature control  I would like to have both of these items available to me as a Ford Explorer Sport owner  especially since the other Explorer models offer them  But I don t want to end this review on a completely negative note  I really enjoy my Ford Explorer Sport  It s just that when one moves into a new car  at a higher price  you don t expect to lose any valuable features that you had in the old car  you are looking for more and in particular  better handling  Ford diminished the quality of the Explorer Sport in this re design  Looking back on my decision  I d probably have looked harder at the Jeep Liberty and the Land Rover Freelander  Although more expensive than the Ford Explorer Sport  I think they are better values  
 I bought this 96 Ranger extended cab a few months ago  and so far I m glad I did  Originally I was looking for a compact car because I commute about 20 miles every day  and gas prices were on the way up  But I drove literally every compact  and most mid sized  cars available  and I just do not fit  I am a pretty big guy  6 3 quot  and the cockpit style front seats of most newer cars these days do not accommodate my size very well  I typically felt a bit cramped from side to side So I got the idea of trying a small pickup  I have always thought that I would like a pickup  but they often seemed impractical because of the passenger limitations  my wife and I have 2 young boys  But I started looking into small  extended cab pickups with the idea that we could all fit on those occasions when we HAD to  I looked at Toyota s  Nissan s  Chevy s  and Ford Rangers  I decided on a Ranger for the following reasons 1  Price 2  Reliability  based on Consumer Reports 3  Looks Originally I was looking at the 4 cylinder engines for gas mileage purposes  But after driving a few I set my sights on a V6  The 4 banger seemed quite a bit underpowered to me  and that was with NO load  After a long search  I found the one I bought  4 0 V6  and so far I love it The cab is quite roomy  especially if I don t have to worry about somebody sitting behind me in one of the fold out seats  With people in back  I need to scoot up a bit  but it s still fairly comfortable  My kids fit great in back  and they always want to sit back there The ride feels about right to me  It s plenty comfortable for my daily commute  with just enough of a stiffer truck feel  The 4 0L V6 has plenty of power  especially with the manual transmission on mine  I have not towed anything yet  but I did haul 1 2 ton of sand the other day without any trouble I have only minor complaints so far  The  quot Check Engine quot  light came on for awhile  I checked the Owner s Manual and it indicated that there was some kind of emissions problem  I decided to wait it out  and it went off after a week  Also the back end is pretty light and there are times I feel a little slippage cornering  In the winter I think some weight will be necessary  The mileage is not bad for the big engine  I am typically getting around 18 20 mpg  mostly highway miles but some city mixed in I would highly recommend this truck for what I use it for daily driving and occasional hauling br br  
 We bought our Ford Thunderbird in April l999  Obviously it was a used car  It is a l997 and it had 28 000 miles on it  I thought that was a lot of miles for a car  we have been use to buying  quot little old lady cars quot You know the kind that hardly have any miles on it  Well  we had searched around for cars that can seat three across the back seat without a hump in the seat or on the floor  We had checked out new and used cars in our price range  under  20 000   way under  This car sold for  12 000  We got a little trade in on our 1988 full sized Caprice   basically paid for the tax  The driver must have driven on a lot of rocky roads because it had some rock dents in the front  We do have one of those  quot bras quot  that we take on and off it  We now have 4l 000 miles on it and have hardly had any problems besides routine repairs  This is a red car so it looks kind of sporty  pleased our teenage son  I hope it lasts a long time because I hate buying cars My husband is the main driver of this car since I drive the van  transporting more people  It does seat five people but can be kind of squishing in the back for tall people  We have a sunroof and I think that is another plus  I guess I kind of wish I had a convertible and that is kind of close to one If you have a hard time getting into small vehicles  this one could be a problem   especially if you are getting into the back seat  This is only a two door car Well  hope I have helped someone with a car buying decision br br  
 You want a safe vehicle  Well the early 90 s models are a terrific choice of transportation  I have a 1994  green  Ford F 150  I love how big and comfortable it is  Being in such a large  heavy vehicle makes me feel safer about driving and having my nieces in the truck with me  And the ride is very smooth and comfortable  There is only one problem that I have with this truck  It sucks up gas  I have dual tanks and I still have to fill up every 2 to 3 days  I use this truck to hall stuff like firewood  fencing  furniture  etc  But mainly I just go to school in it  To tell you the truth  the gas is really worth it  I love this truck and I hope you go out and get one TODAY br br  
 This truck is the best vehicle that i have ever owned  My truck has 103 000 miles on it and never had a problem with this vehicle  I have put two sets of tires on the truck  The first set i put on were cheap tires so i went back to the stock Firestones that it comes with off the assembly line  I have the 2 3L engine  The engine is a little on the slow side but it runs great  It does have some decent power for its size  I would highly recommend this truck to anyone that is going to buy one  And just for some more reference my father owns the 93 Ranger XLT and it has 165 000 miles on it and it runs like a top     
 I really enjoy my little red 1997 Ford Escort  The size seems just about perfect for easy handling  for one thing  Also  the heater works very well to warm the car up fairly quickly on a cold day  faster than my mother s Taurus  My aunt actually picked this car out for me as it was a moderately priced used vehicle  bought May 98 for  10 000  The only things I don t like about it are minor  I don t like the cup holders  anything larger than a  small  can tips over when you turn sharply  also  the gear shift will smash larger cups when you put the car in park  The horn also seems to require a lot of pressure to get it to honk  It has a nice rear window defrost  I also enjoy the remote control trunk and the foldable back seats  Driving is very pleasant  the car is comfortable and responds well  The model I own is a 4 door  perfect for my family of 4  Anyone who likes a maneuverable  comfortable small car should buy it  I suppose those with large families or hauling needs shouldn t  
 The Ford Ranger is sharp looking truck and provides a comfortable ride  I t has been great for getting back and forth to work and has been very reliable  However if you want to pass someone the four cylinder engine does not provide enough power to do it without downshifting  and I would always hesitate before trying to pass on an up hill slope  Overall the paint seems to be holding up very well as are the factory alloy wheels  Braking and handling provide no major complaints If you are looking to do heavy hauling this is not recommended though it should do fine with the 6 cylinder version  This is going to be a wonderful starter vehicle for my son when he turn sixteen next year  
 When purchasing a new or used vehicle  one always wants to be as knowledgeable as possible about the options available  However  sometimes no amount of research can prepare you for the treachery that lies ahead  when you make an error purchasing a vehicle  The Ford Taurus is a perfect example of this paradox  When researching this particular vehicle  you will find raving reviews from many reviewers  everyone from housewives to the consumer reports The problem is  or it appears that  generally when a person is attesting to  or commenting on the reliability of a car particularly a new car  it is generally before the problems have taken place The Ford Taurus is relatively pleasing to look at  with it s sporty  areo dynamic design  The interior is very comfortable and roomy  The ride is quiet and smooth  and it generally gets very reasonable fuel mileage  Having all these things going for it however  does not alleviate the frustration of the fact that there have been so many recalls on many different areas of the vehicle  transmission  steering stabilizers  air conditioning  electrical system  etc  that it spends more time in the repair facility than it does in a driveway As well  I was incredibly disappointed and frustrated with the attitude and the lack of concern shown by the Ford Motor Company  when notified of the seemingly chronic problems that arose with the vehicle  Although this vehicle has been rated very highly in the safety tests performed on vehicles in this class  and although it is a pleasing vehicle as far as aesthetics  A consumer would certainly want to take into account the potential lack of reliability  as well as the difficulty in getting the adequate and appropriate service performance from Ford Motor Company that would make this car acceptable to own     
 Ok  Well I have a 1999 Nissan Altima and I recently got into an accident and the air bags did not come out  it was a head on collision and the sensors we correct  But no Air bags  Everyone be carful and get your Nissans checked before the accident  I had the tested and they were default  It is ok now I am told  But next time i ll have them tested first  I like the car and it runs really great  it is affordable and dependable  Just check the airbags  This car is a great family car  It takes us everywhere  I am not saying it is a bad car  Every car should be inspected  But I just have seen this alot in Nissans  And the service center refused to take any fault Everyone should stand behind there product good or bad   
 I have a 91 Escort Gt  I bought it because i liked the body style  After many years and miles I needed to get a new car  I debated on getting another Escort  but chose instead a 2002 Ford Focus  The Ford Focus was a replacement too for the Escort which was supposedly going to be discontinued  Needless to say SweetPea my 2002 Ford Focus was hit by another motorist who was speeding and had no insurance  So while my own car is being repaired  i ve had the opportunity to drive a Escort ZX2  I have to be honest with you  The body style is nice and sporty  The controls are like my 91 Escort GT  But I must admit I like my Ford Focus better  It seems roomier inside  and the trunk is larger than in the Escort  The visibility in the Escort ZX2 is the same as in my Escort but the visibility in SweetPea my 2002 Ford Focus is better  I like Fords  What I look for is body style comfort visibility  and how the vehicle controls are placed in the dashboard  Front wheel drive is nice  Automatic transmission  and controls within arms reach  Fords are good cars  when it comes to the engine etc  i must admit i m clueless  I ve always gone for the body style  price range  and how comfortable a vehicle is too drive  and comfort for passengers  My chance to drive a ZX2 has been nice  but even my passengers have told me they can t wait until I get SweetPea back  Hopefully today I ll be able to have my own car back in my possession  
 I had never owned a new vehicle before as I always had someone around that could take care of repairs for me  However when I moved to the US I needed a reliable car and with my total lack of car knowledge and or availability of people to help me I decided I had better buy a new one I really only considered the Sentra and the Civic   the Sentra was highly favored because I had rented one once and fell in love with the way it handled and I felt it looked better than most of the economy sub compacts  I also considered a Nissan as my sister had bought one years ago and had very few problems with it until she finally sold it 10 years later Even tho reviews say the Sentra is very boring to look at I feel it s sleek and nice looking   especially for a small car  I did hate the way it looked on the back end so added a spoiler which dramatically improved the appearance in my opinion  I felt the interior of the car defied the fact that it is an economy car as compared to the Civic  I feel it almost has a luxury feel and is a VERY good value for the money The car handles well  especially considering the fact that it only uses a 4 liter engine  Gas mileage is great About the only thing I really dislike about the vehicle is the relative lack of comfort for long journeys  Also  I wouldn t want to have to be a back seat passenger for any length of time The car has had zero problems other than a lock that tends to occasionally stick  When i ve visited the dealer for maintenance I ve been more than pleased  The service department   more than any other reason is why I ll likely buy another Nissan br br  
 Ah  my 1997 Passat TDI Wagon  The reasons I bought this for vehicle  Fuel Mileage  at 40  mpg it can t be beat for a car this size  With a 18 gallon main fuel tank and a 6 gallon reserve you have a cruising distance of appx  750 miles  This is truly a low maintainence vehicle  as long as you wait for the glow plug light to go out when you are starting they should last at least 150 000 miles  I also recommended that you idle the car for a few minutes after a long drive for a few minutes in your parking space so that the turbo charger can cool down  this will only save you money in the long run The car is great  it is truly a family car with true seating for 5 plus plenty of storage in the rear  The car has plenty of safety features  DRL s  Dual Airbags  Tether Straps and 4 wheel Disc ABS  which is all very nice when you go to visit your Insurance Agent  The car is steel not plastic  solidly engineered  Volkswagens hold there value Some not so great things  there is no acceleration from a dead stop  again its a diesel wagon not a race car though  On the highway it gets right up and goes though  Heat  as with most diesels it takes awhile for the heat to kick up and into the cabin Please let me explain some things about VW  there are German VW s and Brazilian Mexican VW s  do yourself a favor find a Wolfsburgh Edition if you can  these cars are made in Germany  The others are German engineered and put together in South America and they really lack the quality of the true German VW s You should expect 300 000 miles from this engine if taken care of correctly  examples oil changed every 3000 miles  you can t slack up on changing the oil in this car  Glow plugs  again wait for the light to go out or you will blow them and they can be expensive  The shift point for this car is 2000 rpm not 3000 like a gas engine take care that you are not over reving the engine All in all  this is a great car for the family and if taken care off you should have it for a long time     
 Some buddies told me about this great little program  test drive an I35 and get a free Palm Pilot  So I did  I figured I could get a nifty free new toy and test drive a car  two of my favorite activities Infiniti along with Lexus has been known for their great dealerships and service  The big parent company reign in their dealerships tightly unlike the Germans  Its a funny thing really  that both Lexus and Infiniti don t exist outside the US at all  those models wear their Toyota and Nissan badges  Does that say something about American consumers  Dealing with the sales department was friendly and courteous  The salesman seemed less informed than I was about the Nissan Infiniti relationship  for instance  I told him about the new G35 really being a new Nissan Skyline in the rest of the world It s also pretty well known that this car is a Maxima  I have not driven the Maxima at all but have ridden in it in its SE and base forms  How similiar are they  They share the same platform  engine  suspension with only changes to the exterior shell and interior pieces  That said  the Maxima has always been a favorite of mine for a large sedan with plenty of power on tap and half decent handling  If I had a family 3 years ago and was in the market for a roomy sedan  this car would of been at the top of my list To the car  Step inside the car and you can feel that it is well built and handsome  My particular test car had the heated seats plus the sport package and sunroof as well  The seats were covered in a beautifully soft leather  mildly firm  and very relaxing  There was much maple coloured wood all over the dash of the car  shiny and laquered and seemed to be of good quality  Shunt lines were very reasonable and tight and pieces seemed well assembled  However  alot of the plastic bits like the door release levers  the turn signal levers  etc seemed to come straight out of the Maxima  Not that they were GM flimsy by any means but not very luxurious either  Compared to the materials used in my Audi A4  they seemed cheaper in comparison  I will say that the interior  DOES  seem very warm and inviting in contrast to my car  This seems to be a characterstic of Japanese cars  as a friend s Lexus GS300 had also that same very inviting feel to it  In contrast  my car seems to feel like an efficient machine  tight  no nonsense but colder with aluminum trim  chrome  instead of wood and more natural toned plastics  If Audi feels Bauhaus  then Infiniti and Lexus feels Mediterranean The layout was very simple to work with  There were more buttons than I expected but less so than the Germans  It was intuitive enough for anyone who s driven a Nissan or Toyota  The room inside was cavernous just like the Maxima as was the trunk as well  The sound system  like any Infiniti  was wonderful  Maybe I heard too many good things about it  but I was disappointed  Bass was very good but not mindblowing  Highs came out well though the midrange seemed a bit washed to me  It was better than my stock 8 speaker 80watt system definately but not  a lot  better On the outside  I felt the car seemed bland but that is my own judgement  It had the outlines of the Maxima still there with a few bits and pieces changed over  There were no wheel arches at all which is a disappoint to me  It is completely smooth from wheel to door  I really couldn t find anything exquisite with the exterior at all  It was blandly generic with not even a subtle amount of flair anywhere But now the fun part  driving  Unfortunately  the area where the dealer was located is on a busy highway here in Northern NJ  Ask anyone who lives here and you ll find out NJ has the most cars in the nation per square mile and most of them sit up in the northern part  I did  however  find a little clearing in the road to check out what this car was capable off First the engine  Everyone knows about the legandary Nissan VQ series V6 s and this one didn t disappoint  Mind bogglingly smooth and a broad  broad torque band makes this motor feel like an I6  The engine note was extremely muted however though you could here a tiny bit of deep bass rumble  By staying in one gear  I could test the capability of an engine more accurately  as the capabilities of the transmission don t get in the way  By far  this is one of the better engines I ve driven  one of the best V6 s around  I would say it is equal to the Lexus Inline 6 s in smoothness  The BMW I6 s have more of a life to them but I have a feeling its due to less sound insolation more than engine design  That said  if I had to point out the best characteristic of this car  it would be the engine But it was the transmission that was a let down  At 255 hp and 245ft lbs of torque  I was prepared to be blown away by this car  since I was used to my little 170hp  166 ft lbs with my 1 8T  I too have an automatic  yes  yes don t make fun of me   but with one major difference  a 5th gear  Yes  this entry level luxary sedan has a FOUR GEAR SLUSHBOX  As a result  the car  while definately faster than mine  didn t seem to move as fast as I thought it could  The torque convertor also seemed sloppier than mine as well with lots of engine revving and the car not moving  The manual shifting mode was interesting and annoying at the same time  It was also extremely similiar to the Lexus design  that is you have to move up and to the left or right to upshift through a jagged looking gate  While I appreciate the ability to slam down 2 gears easy  I find the sequential Tiptronic design of mine easier  To downshift twice  you would have to move down and to the left  or was it the right  and then down again  I could do the same on my car by just clicking the steering wheel paddle shifter down twice  I suppose its a matter of getting used to As for the handling of this car  it felt exactly how I envisioned it  tight but large  Maybe it was the sitting position giving a phychological effect too  but this car felt big  It felt like a very heavy car but a stiff suspension  I was  however  surprised that it was surprising supple on bumps and also tight in corners  It wasn t as tight or progressive as my own car but then again I have aftermarket Koni coilovers which are performance oriented  Hats off to the Nissan engineers  Steering was much too light for my taste and there was practically no road feel whatsoever  I am sure that the Japanese engineers are capable of putting better steering into a car  but the manufacturers still prefer doing it this way  I suppose the roadgoing public likes the ease of driving with you pinky and being isolated from the road irregularities  but an enthusiastic driver like myself wants a weighted steering for confidence and wants to know how my car is tracking too  Its better than say a Camry but not alot better than an Accord and nowhere close to an Audi or BMW There were 2 major problems in the handling I found though  The first was in corners  Any sort of irregularity in the road seemed to upset it  After glaring through some specs  I found the culprit  The Maxima I35 uses a beam axle in the rear  A cheap suspension is a big no  no in today s cuttroat market  This is akin to the BMW Z3 and its money saving technique of also putting in a beam axel in the rear instead of its famous Z link design in the new 3 series  Bad  bad car makers  The other problem was  as others have also found  torque steer  Generally this is a problem with high torque front wheel drive cars  The most famous example of this are the higher powered Saabs  Viggens and Aeros  so test drive one of these to find out what torque steer is  While I rounded a corner  I purposely gunned the throttle and the wheel jerked in my hand as well  Definately torque steer  In contrast  my own car  equipped with quattro and a 4 link front suspension  just rounds a corner easily with no suspense at all  However  it does also have a lot less power After all that  we come to the conclusion  Would I buy this car now  today  The answer  NO  Why you ask  Cause there s this new car with very nice styling  just as much interior space  an engine thats slightly detuned from this one  with an BRAND NEW platform and NEW rear multilink suspension  To top it off  its base price is about  5K cheaper  What car is this  The V6 Nissan Altima  This car suffers from too much platform sharing much like GM cars  My own car shares a lot of parts with other cars  A6  Passat  but I can feel the difference  Smaller wheelbase  better tuned suspension  completely different interior makes it a unique car  Nissan had over 35 different platforms when it was in red ink and it has since been reduced to about 5 or 6  They should look over at Volkswagen Audi to see how to share platforms the right way How it compares to competitors b Non Luxury Choices  Nissan Altima   I can t stress the Altima enough as the best buy for the Accord Camry market  Great engine and great design makes this car a bargain for the price  You get the new Skyline derived rear multilink suspension and the equally good VQ engine with a slightly less pretty interior and less service  But for that price point Volkswagen Passat   Slightly less expensive but still more than say a Camry  the Passat is a great choice as well  The power can seem anemic though compared to the I35 and Altima but handles well  though too soft sprung  and has one of the best interiors period  An optioned out Passat would run roughly  35 with AWD  190hp V6 vs  a slightly optioned I35 with FWD  255hp  Decisions  decision Ford Mondeo   Shame we can t get this car here in the States  but this is the successor to the Contour  It is was the Focus is to the small car market  good handling  decent but slow engines and good build quality  It depends on money of course and where you live  but you can t go wrong with this car   if you  can  get this car  then you would have to compare it with a Maxima since the I35 doesn t exist in the rest of the world  Former European Car of the Year b Luxury Choices  Lexus ES   better track record  but the I35 wins in almost every other department  Get the I35 instead Audi A6 series   Around the same price as the I35 with less power in the 3 0 and more in the 2 7T  Handling wise  with wishbone rears  4 link fronts  sport suspension  and Quattro AWD system  its a more capable package  And of course  noone builds an interior like Audi  The decision comes down to more power and better reliability in the Infiniti vs  better handling  AWD  and German interior in the Audi Lexus GS 300   less power but you get wishbone suspensions all around and RWD  The price will you run you about  5K overall but you get a better overall performance package in handling plus all that great Lexus service and quality  Its a tough choice  but it comes down to the almighty dollar BMW 5 series   Hey there expensive  but you get what you pay for  Better interiors though using a different design philosophy  What do you get  For once alot less power  However  50 50 weight distribution  RWD  multilink rear suspension  this stuff doesn t come cheap  There s a reason why Bimmers are as good as they are  This car is nimble and handles like a dream  Again  it comes down to the dollars Infiniti G35   this is an updated suggestion but the new G35 is a very good contender into the midsize luxury market  Fast  great handling  maybe a bit unrefined for a first try but nontheless a very nice car  This is based off Nissan s new FM  front mid  platform which is also used in the new Nissan Z350 coupe  
 OK  a little background on myself  I ve owned two Toyota 4wd pickups  one was an ExtraCab  one wasn t  I ve owned full size GMCs and Fords  and I ve driven just about all of the small pick up class brands  Second  let me give my disclaimer  Having owned a few pick ups in my life and knowing the loyalties that come with pick up ownership  I am not about to force my preference on anyone  However  I can honestly say that without any hesitation that I have never been happier with the truck I am driving today  I bought my 2000 Ford Ranger in March of 2000  The Ford dealership was the last place I went  only after combing the Toyota  Nissan  and Chevy lots  Nissan went out the window after about ten minutes  Despite the weird looks of their entry into the smaller truck market  the salesman had the ability to annoy me right off the lot  quot that excite  cha   quot hey  buddy that excite  cha quot whatever  Nissan  Anyway  Toyota almost had me  I ve been a fan of Toyotas for awhile and would still recommend them to anyone that had the money and didn t mind having to buy a new truck every few years  Thats my only gripe about Toyota  They just seem to give way and start to feel a little shaky after a few years of semi hard driving  I d hate to see how they fare in real difficult terrain  Another minus  The paper thin doors  As far as Chevy goes  close but not quite  Chevy seems to have a decent product  but I think that if you are going to go for a Chevy  make it a full size  One thing I ve never really liked about Chevy is that they have never impressed me as a  working  truck  They always seemed too  street  for me  On to Ford  Despite having had on of the closest to pleasant experiences I ve ever had at a dealership  the Ranger just worked for me  Solid doors and tailgate  the windows closed tightly  and the engine and transmission worked  and still work  like they should  I purchased the 3 0 V6  and so far have had no problems  Semi frequent obstacles have required me to utilize the shift on the fly 4WD  which has worked like a charm  Only once  on the beach  has it felt a little squirrely  But we survived intact  I still believe that a truck is a truck  and you are never going to get loyalists to change their views on which is best  I m glad I did  though  I guess my ultimate advice is this  If you want to buy a truck  go to every brand dealer and drive them all  full size and smaller versions  Thats what I did  and it put me in the seat of the Ranger  and firmly planted in my mind that my next truck will be a Ranger  too br br  
 I purchased my Ranger new in March of 1996  I purchased it because I needed a truck to use while remodeling a home  but I wanted a vehicle that would be small enough to commute to work  I picked the Ranger over the other small trucks out there for a couple of reasons  First and foremost  the Ranger was rated at or near the top in most of the ratings categories in Consumer Reports  Second  in its price range  I felt that the Ranger offered more in terms of styling and options  The XLT package with sport wheels dress it up nicely  I have been more than pleased with my Ranger  It has 65 000 miles on it now and I haven t had a single repair  The 2 3 liter engine with the five speed manual transmission is sporty and fun to drive  I was originally worried that it would be under powered  but for light hauling and in most driving conditions the engine is more than adequate  The truck rides very well  smoother than small trucks I ve driven in the past  There are  however  some sacrifices made when purchasing a light truck  The room in the cab is tight and unless you have a camper shell  shopping can be a problem  My only regret is that did not invest in the extended cab model  Overall  I give my Ranger an excellent rating  I would highly recommend a Ranger to anyone considering the purchase of a small pick up     
 About five years ago auto manufacturers began to realize that consumers 146 sets of needs did not always match up with existing product categories  What if someone wanted to image and handling of a sports car  but the carrying capacity of an SUV  Or the image of an SUV  but the carrying capacity of a minivan and the ride of a luxury car  In response to this realization  we are now seeing  147crossover 148 vehicles that do not neatly fit into any conventional category  The Toyota Matrix is one such vehicle   As is its twin  the Pontiac Vibe The Matrix  especially in XRS form  is sort of a tall station wagon   sports car cross  It is very similar in size and interior versatility to the Chrysler PT Cruiser  but with ultra modern rather than retro styling  It was engineered by Toyota on the new Corolla chassis and is manufactured in a GM Toyota joint venture plant managed by Toyota in California  Pontiac sells a vehicle that differs largely in exterior styling as the Vibe  Three trim lines are offered  base  XR  and XRS  The first two differ in interior trim and standard equipment  They share a 130 horsepower engine  123 horsepower with the optional all wheel drive  The XRS has a 180 horsepower engine  from the Celica GT S  All of the engines are the same size  four cylinders displacing 1 8 liters  Contrary to some reviews  though  the blocks are not the same  The higher output engine has a wider bore and shorter stroke to enable higher engine speeds  Bore and stroke aside  the key variable is how high in the RPM range each engine maintains its torque output  i e  breathes  Both engines produce roughly the same amount of power up to about 5 000 RPM  but past that point the base engine begins to run out of steam  Unlike in the Vibe  in the Matrix the 180 horsepower engine is available with an automatic  When I tested the Vibe  I drove the performance model with a stick  so this time I drove the XR with an automatic i Update   I have read that the XRS is no longer available with an automatic  However  Toyota s web site continues to display this configuration b Styling and Accommodations  I strongly prefer the styling of the Vibe to that of the Matrix  which intentionally includes a number of quirky elements  Where the Vibe is styled to look somewhat familiar and more or less conventionally attractive  Toyota clearly wanted to stir controversy with its version  I especially don 146t care for the sheetmetal creases that trace a curve over each wheel opening  The pinched rear side window doesn 146t do much for me  either  as it accentuates the extreme height of the bodyside  Maybe this plays with the 20 something crowd  but not with me  That said  some Matrices are uglier than others  A white base model with hubcaps in the showroom was hideous  The red XR with aero package and 17 148 alloys  replicating the look of a loaded XRS  looked much better  The Matrix comes standard with rocker panel moldings  With the  270  147sport plus 148 package the look of these is continued onto the front and rear bumper  creating an even line around the bottom edge of the body  Without this package  the  147chin 148 of the car looks strangely weak  as the standard bumper is higher than the rocker moldings aft of the front wheel well  A no brainer given the reasonable price The interior styling is a bit more conventional  though still unattractive  Likely because of the Pontiac connection  the gauges are red  They are lit all the time  even during the day  To cater to the young target audience  each gauge is surrounded by a thick chromed plastic ring and the instrument panel has a metallic look to it  Nothing especially tasteful here  though  The pair of gimmicks cannot overcome the general artlessness of the interior design  The dash seems cobbled together  with too many separate surfaces and shapes and no unifying theme As with the Pontiac  the seat fabric is available in light gray and dark gray  The light gray looks downright cheap  The dark gray looks much better  though it 146s still nothing to rave about  I drove a PT Cruiser the same day  At least in the all charcoal interior of the car I drove  which might be new for 2003  older PTs I 146ve seen were a two tone taupe inside  the PT 146s interior seemed both much more stylish and higher in quality The strong point of the Matrix 146s interior is the amount of volume available inside this fairly compact vehicle  All of the seats are positioned mini SUV high  This affords good thigh support for adults in the rear seat  a feature too often lacking in largish sedans  Headroom and legroom is adequate for two adults front and rear  Not only could my feet fit under the front seat  but I could lift my toes up and they still didn 146t touch the seat 146s underside  This is a fairly narrow vehicle  though  so three adults will fit in the rear only in a pinch Despite the high seating position  the view out the side windows isn 146t especially open  The Matrix 146s beltline  base of side windows  starts fairly high and rises continuously as it moves rearward  Shorter rear seat passengers  and especially kids  might feel a bit closed in as a result Every seat but that of the driver can be folded  opening up long and tall cargo space  Cargo space width is limited  though  as the rear wheelwells intrude nearly all the way to the rear edge  I measured the available width  and it came to 40 inches  This is two shy of the length of my double stroller when folded  The stroller will probably still fit  just not flat on the floor  The cargo area and folded seatbacks are covered with a hard plastic with raised ridges to facilitate scar free  low effort loading and unloading  This surface is much more slippery than carpet would be  but numerous tie downs are provided on the walls and floor to secure objects  The Matrix I drove had an optional cargo mat covering the hard surface One especially neat feature  a standard electrical outlet is located in the center console  So forget about converters  you can just plug in your notebook computer  hair dryer  whatever using the regular plug  Why hasn 146t anyone done this before  The only other place I 146ve seen this is in a fully loaded Toyota Avalon  It seems more appropriate here This is a Toyota  so reliability should be good  That said  a number of interior trim pieces were of dubious quality   On the Road  When I drove the Vibe  I didn 146t buy the tall sports car thing  So this time I decided to see if the Matrix worked as less ambitious  basic transportation  Sure  the XR I drove had the full sport exterior treatment  and would have looked much worse without it  but it had the 130 horse engine  so I largely gave it a pass in terms of sporty expectations With my expectations thus diminished  I didn 146t have a problem with the acceleration of the base engine  even with the automatic  In normal driving it moved the car as well as I wanted  I didn 146t feel as if I had to floor it just to get around  That said  this was largely because the transmission generally worked the engine hard without my having to prod it  I say  147generally 148 because the transmission was sometimes reluctant to downshift  From a dead stop  however  the transmission held up its end  In moderate acceleration  it shifted at 4500 5000 RPM   Since the XRS engine makes similar power up to this level  I suspect that performance in normal driving is very similar  What this translates to is lots and lots of engine noise of the moderately rough four cylinder variety  It sounds very much the typical Japanese econobox  just pulling a bigger box  On the flip side  fuel economy should also be econoboxish  with EPA ratings of 28 33 The XRS  with its more powerful engine  rates only 21 27 with the automatic  I m surprised the numbers are so different  since the two engines share a basic design and displacement  Shorter gearing in the XRS could be a factor  At any rate  most people don t rev an engine over 5 000 RPM except on rare occasions  When the lower price and higher fuel economy of the 130 horsepower engine are taken into account  it is clearly the best choice for nearly all of those who will be satisfied with the rest of the car As with the Vibe  my main issues lie elsewhere  To begin with  the driving position is awful  The shifter is mounted on an extension of the dash  It is a couple inches too far forward  a couple inches too high  and a bit far to the right  I fixed this in the Matrix by driving the automatic   The Matrix in the showroom was a manual  allowing me to confirm that I cannot stand the shifter location in these cars  Even with this problem out of the way  I never felt comfortable behind the wheel  something about the wheel seat pedals relationship is just wrong  Maybe it 146s the minivan overtones The seats don 146t help  The cushion is small and overly soft  so that I didn 146t feel properly supported  The seat 146s side bolsters are reasonably prominent  but they 146re too soft to do much good  To make things worse  there is no handle on the door to use as a brace 151only an indentation in the armrest that is too shallow and too far rearward for this purpose  People who like a firm handhold on the door will be very unhappy here The Matrix has the same handling quirks as the Vibe  but they 146re more excusable in its less performance oriented guise  The steering is pretty good  with quick responses  possibly too quick for some people  Unfortunately  the quickness of the steering is the beginning and end of the Matrix 146s sporty driving persona  It leans more than I 146d like  especially at the rear  and understeer is prominent  When you try to drive aggressively the vehicle sends a clear message to back off  It refuses to reward such behavior with any entertainment value  The optional 17 148 wheels do not significantly alter the dynamics of the chassis  Like those seat bolsters  they seem to be offered for stylistic purposes only  The chassis rides fairly well  nothing luxurious but definitely up to the compact car average  So there 146s room to stiffen it up without totally killing ride quality  While the engineers are adjusting the suspension  torque steer requires some attention  Sure  there 146s not much torque to manage here  but under full throttle front end gets squirrelly  bobbing and weaving a bit  Overall I felt I was driving a subcompact chassis carrying more car body than it could handle  The PT Cruiser was a much more substantial feeling  more composed  better handling vehicle  Maybe this is because it is a heavier vehicle  Althought the Chrysler is a couple of inches shorter  in length  and narrower than the Toyota  it weighs about 350 lbs  more  a significant amount  While the Toyota s relatively light weight is good for economy  the measures taken to obtain it result in an economy car feel  However  as long as you go in expecting the feel of a tall econobox  I guess you won t be disappointed b Pricing  The Matrix XR I drove stickered for  19 187 with the  560 17 148 wheels   270 spoiler package  both needed to make the Matrix look decent  16 148 alloys are passable  but cost only  150 less  cruise control  CD changer stereo  side airbags  floor mats  and cargo mat  Many additional options are available  including ABS for a very reasonable  300  and a sunroof for  750  If you really want to put the price over the top  there 146s a NAV system with CD changer for  1 890  To make comparisons easier  let 146s look at base vehicles with decent appearance packages and cruise control  Set up like this  the Matrix goes for  18 395  Edmunds suggests dealers don 146t discount this car  but I find this hard to believe A similarly equipped Pontiac Vibe stickers for  18 740  not including the  500 monotone paint option  and Edmunds says dealers tend to get that much  That is  except for the typical GM rebate  currently  1 500 on the Vibe  This brings the actual price to around  17 240  In my review of the Vibe I noted how the Matrix was a better value due to slightly lower base prices and much lower option prices   Pontiac charges roughly 50  more for the same options  However  the rebate  not offered when I wrote the Vibe review  more than compensates for Pontiac 146s higher prices  such that the Vibe in most cases is now the better value  Especially if you prefer its styling  as I do  The Chrysler PT Cruiser tends to cost a bit more than the Toyota and Pontiac  For come reason  websites are not listing Chrysler 146s 2003 prices yet  In 2002  a similarly equipped PT Cruiser Touring Edition stickers for  19 815  Edmunds suggests dealers typically get about  18 900  but much of this discount could represent closeout pricing for remaining 2002 models  A  1 500 rebate is offered on 2002 PT Cruisers  but none on the 2003  yet  For a 2002 at least the price would be about a grand lower than that for the Matrix  about  17 400  A 2003 could be a grand higher  though  Either way  roughly the same ballpark for what I now think is a better vehicle  Of course  if you don 146t like the PT Cruiser 146s styling  you 146re not going to want one regardless of the price Finally  for those still not sure of this tall wagon thing  Ford offers the Focus ZX5  I haven 146t driven this version  but was extremely impressed by the SVT  The Focus ZX5 similarly equipped stickers for  17 815  Edmunds suggests a  450 dealer discount  and Ford offers a  500 rebate on 2003s  bringing the typical price to  16 865 Overall  the Matrix ends up in the same ballpark as the others  such that different levels of optional equipment and shifting rebates could easily change the order  In short  except perhaps between the Matrix and Vibe price should not be a deciding factor b Last Words  I like the concept for this car  and I m even warming to the look when it is properly optioned  but I cannot get over what it is like to sit in and drive  I d personally much rather have a Ford Focus or Chrysler PT Cruiser  
 I owned a 91 Escort LX Wagon  passed down from parent  while first having gotten my license  This car had a 136 000 miles on it when i received it  and sold it to a friend with 139 000 miles  It keeps on asking for more punishment  because we were both teenage first time drivers  While I will admit that the interior materials are cheap  the stereo sucks  and there were no power windows or locks  I think that it was bought new for about 11 000 dollars  so what s to be expected  The engine was fairly punchy for being only 88hp  The car is light enough for it  The steering is a little sloppy  but not bad  I felt very secure in this car  and always trusted the reliability  It had rust under the back wheel wells  but I fixed it myself  The paint had begun to faid as well  it hadn t really been cared for before I got it  Either way I think that it is a safe bet  and a good  easy car for first time drivers to learn on  I drive a 95 Dodge Avenger now  and probably would hate to go back to the less refined Escort    read my gushing review of my Avenger  love that car   but I probably would get one real cheap if the Avenger was in an accident  But that Escort is an amazing car br br  
 In 1998 I bought a Ford Contour  The dealership said they used it as a rental car  So I thought the car should have no problems  It was a nice looking car with power locks  power windows  cruise  and tilt steering  I thought I had just bought the perfect car About a month after I got it I was driving in the rain when I lost my power steering  Where it went I don t know  So in the shop it went  So they replaced some electrical wiring and said it was fixed  So I thought it was fixed  Until the next month when it died at a intersection and I had to push it  So back in the shop it went  They replaced some computer chips and said it was fixed  but you guessed it it died again about a week later and wouldn t start  So this time I had a little computer they hooked up to my car for a week to see if it would show anything wrong  It never did After about four months of my car always being in the shop and no one knowing why it died for no reason I decided to trade it off  I will never own a Ford again br br  
 I purchased my Windstar in 1996  It was a year old  It had only been used as a rental  and so for a  95 model was practically brand new  I believe at the time we paid  15 000 00 for it and have never regretted it br br My family was just beginning to grow and still has plans of growing so we needed something more reliable that the little Ford Mustang we had   I love my mustang  and more roomy  We lived in Texas and had family in   Missouri and Oklahoma so needless to say we were making a lot of long trips br br I fell instantly in love with my Windstar the moment I saw it and new it was   for me when I sat behind the wheel  It is the most comfortable vehicle I   have ever had or hope to have  At first I wanted a full size conversion van and was disappointed at the idea purchasing a mini van  but my Ford  Windstar changed all that br br My Ford Windstar gets almost as good a gas mileage as my Mustang and   has an even smoother ride  It rides just like a car  I especially like the way the dash slopes back giving it not only a classical look but also a very comfortable foot rest on long otherwise dreary road trips    br My Windstar seats 7 or 8 adults comfortably and has multiple cup holders   around the van    br My Windstar is also just a plain good looking van  It s white with red   pin stripes and has a beautiful blue interior that is very resistant to wear br I love it  It s part of the family br    br br br  
 My husband drives long haul for a living and we purchased a Focus because he wanted me to have a dependable car for getting the kids around  The price was right also  It handled wonderfully  very nice to drive  Anyone with long legs shouldn t purchase a Focus though because there isn t much leg room  especially in the back  We would have kept ours for a very long time if it wouldn t have been for the dealership we purchased it from  There were major water leaks in ours  and they did nothing to fix them  All they wanted to do for me is replace the carpet  Also  the vehicle we traded in for this car was a big conversion van  Compared to the van  this car was pretty darn loud driving down the road  The tire noise was loud  and also you could feel every bump in the road  I suppose I was just spoiled with my van  In closing  very nice little car  just don t buy one from the same dealership I did br br  
 This car has a big surprise  This fine looking luxury car is very well appointed and is very pleasurable to drive  This car is so smooth and quiet that I have actually tried to start it when it was running  Unbelievably smooth and quiet  Do note that this is the  quot S quot  model  the one with the  quot sleeper quot  engine  that comes with the Miller Cycle engine  This is an very powerful engine that if you press the gas just a bit will move that car at a reasonable speed  If you press the gas pedal a bit more firmly this car will press you into the fine leather seat and hold you there until you relax your foot or are traveling well in excess of all know speed limits  And it will do all this with great elegance and comfort  The climate control whispers gently while you are comfortably seated in soft leather with firm support just where you want it  There is only a chrome  quot S quot  to identify this car as different than the plain vanilla Millenia which does run very nicely yet lacks this very potent Miller Cycle engine  The Millenia S handles very easily in normal driving conditions and with it s very low profile tires is also very good in more extreme situations  in fact you will find it hard to believe that such a large car can handle so well that it is a pleasure to traverse those mountain roads  Over all an excellent car at a very attractive price new and an irresistible one used  It does suffer a severe price drop used  making it a very very good used luxury car The only negative is the bland colors that these cars are painted yet there is a solution  A friend repainted her Millenia S as the original  quot Sandstone quot  color was a bit drab and the result is that people stop her on the street to ask her what kind of car this is  do note that she drove this car for a year before the change of color  It is really quite stunning in it s elegance  My advise is if you are considering a luxury sedan give the Millenia a try  you will like it  I suggest that you get an  quot S quot  model for the fun of it  Thank you Kris   
 The car I have is the 93 Vector  Black with sand leather interior  and it s a six speed manual transmission  I have had this car since late July of 2003 and it s just too much fun to drive  True that it s not the same as a sporty rear wheel drive  but it s close enough to emulate rear wheel cornering and yet have the front wheel stability in snow and rain The overall combination of its aesthetics  driving comfort  handling and features makes this an absolute winner  The 17 inch wheels with Pirellis are wonderful  and the ride of the car overall is smooth as butter  One just seems to glide along quietly and when the need arises you can handle bumps and curves in a very tight and sporty fashion I don t think there is any car out there that matches the interior and exterior design of this car  BMW and Audi have pretty much messed up their beauty of days gone by with very non descript and overly squarish looks and tacky glimmering wood trim that is better suited for a Bentley or Rolls Royce  The Saab Vector 93 offers a wonderful and less tacky interior with simple vinyl plastic and brushed metallic interior combinations  The sand leather seats have a nice touch of black leather strips to match the exterior color All the buttons and features are ergonomically designed and provide mostly useful information  The cabin has ample room for four adults and a large trunk space The new improvements in the turbo make it even better because you get enough speed and horsepower to have fun without being a gas guzzler  A full tank gives 400 500 miles easily at highway speeds  
  If you were a car manufacturer  you would do just about anything to have an icon on your hands  Whatever the secret is  Ford Motors knows it  the Ford Mustang is just that b Thus  this car needs little introduction to the buyer  In fact  many people who purchase a Mustang know what they want from the very start  With this in mind  I made the drive to a nearby Ford dealership and gave the base V6 Mustang  fit the budget  a whirl  After returning the keys two days later  I had a pretty good grasp on what the  Stang  was all about b EXTERIOR  8  The Mustang got a major makeup job in 1999  and is unchanged for 2000  minus a  Sport Package  that is available for V6 models  The Mustang s new edgy look took some getting used to for me  but after a while  I began to like it  Even the base models look  more aggressive  than before  The rear track is wider  giving the Mustang a larger rump  The outer sheet metal all around has been rounded off as well  Outside of these cosmetics  the Mustang still sits on one of the industry s oldest rear wheel chasses  I guess Ford s opinion is  why change a good thing b INTERIOR  6  Inside the Mustang  you will see very few changes if any compared to previous models  even 1993  Thus  the  dash looks clean but dated   Cheap plastic abounds  which doesn t spell  durable  in my book  The manual shifter is rather odd looking for my tastes  It also blocks access to the CD controls  The automatic shifter doesn t give you this problem once it s put in  drive  The climate system is around average  but the sound system did not impress me at all  I d recommend upgrading to their Mach Sound System  or just doing one all on your own   i A side note i The Chevy Camaro s stereo sounds much better  although the rest of the interior advantages go to the Mustang  There seems to be a lot of room inside the Mustang  but the back seat is ideally suited for tots  Getting in and out of the back seat is quite a chore  too  The trunk of the Mustang is small  and the glove compartment won t hold anything more than the owner s manual b ENGINE  8  Marked improvements in power were made for 1999  the 3 8L V6 is up 40 ponies to 190hp  and the GT V8 models have been upgraded to 260hp  The way I see it  the new V6  which gives you 220 lb ft  torque   2 750 rpm  gives you  a lot of punch for the money   something you didn t see before the upgrade  While the base engine is not as powerful as the Camaro Firebird engines  it still gives you confident passing ability and may be enough to dissuade you from buying the pricier GT b RIDE  7  The Mustang s suspension was revised for 1999  With these changes went some of the harshness of the ride of previous models  I could feel the difference  The ride is  more solid   too  You will still be able to  drive by Braille  as the saying goes  but the ride is pleasant enough and not jarring  Even though the Mustang is a sports car  its engine makes a little more noise than I d like  especially under hard acceleration  I had to raise my voice numerous times when conversing b HANDLING  7  The Mustang does a decent job handling corners and split second emergency maneuvers  Some body lean was noticed when I intentionally swerved the car around  The brakes of the Mustang were also improved for 1999  and do well when called upon  I recommend the optional All Speed Traction Control for more sure footed performance  You may find it s worth the price b VALUE  7  The Ford Mustang is a  reasonable value   for a pretty good price  you get pretty good performance out of a pretty good sports car  Many people buy the Mustang for the looks  and it will not disappoint  I found the Mustang to be a little stingy on features  but it holds its value better than its GM rivals  which will cease production within the next couple of years  Plus  Mustangs are very easy cars to modify and upgrade b RELIABILITY  6  Consumer Guide has listed reliability for the Mustang as  average  but recently I have noticed an increasing number of disgruntled Mustang owners  The way I see it  any further research will uncover both really happy as well as really ticked Mustang owners  Still  the Mustang did not make a strong case for solid build quality when I drove it  the doors shut with a clang rather than a thud  and a few rattles could be heard coming from the trunk area when I went over bumps b THE VERDICT  AMERICA S PONY CAR HAS IMPROVED  BUT COULD BE BETTER  I can see how the Mustang has done so well  it outsells its GM rivals  Camaro Firebird  by about 2 to 1   combined   In my opinion  it appeals to a broader base of consumers than the GM twins do  But to say I was convinced the base Mustang is the  best  offering for a sports car in this price range might be stretching things a bit  But if an icon is what you want  and you don t mind that everyone  else  is driving one  then give the Mustang a look    Note  This review concerns the BASE V6 Mustang  which is far and away the most popular model bought by consumers  If you want info on the GT or Cobra  check out some of the other excellent articles on this site i b AVERAGE SCORE  7 0 out of 10 VARA S PERSONAL RATING  7 0 out of

 We bought our 1991 Ford Festiva new  and the  quot Korean Komet quot  or  quot Red Rocket quot  is still serving us today  The car gets incredible mileage and almost never needs repairs  and it starts up in even the coldest of weather  It handles well in the snow  and has an AMAZING turning radius  You could park this thing anywhere  I guess the only downside is that if you should get hit in this thing  there s not much car to protect you  Other than that  I think the car has a lot of personality and is a great value  I m a high school student and I just put a new sound system in  and now I can cruise for chicks in my sweet ride while blasting out the beach boys tunes  Woooo br br  
 I got my 2000 Civic EX at the beginning of November and it s the first car I ve owned myself  I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a small car  especially in a city  This is a great first car  it has great handling and good design and gets amazing mileage  It s easy to drive and the interior features enhance the driving experience  especially for short people  like me  who are used to driving cars that are uncomfortable to drive because it s hard to reach things  etc  The drive is very comfortable  even on badly kept roads  The stock stereo system is clear and has very crisp sound  and the stereo has tons of features including a clock  cd player several radio settings and a full option cd player  I live in a city and appreciate a compact car when it comes to looking for parking spaces  I have taken the car on one long trip so far  about a 200 mile weekend trip  there and back  and it proved comfortable for all the passengers and got fantastic mileage  The car is a commuter car  weekend car  and just about everything car for my one person household but I still put it through a lot every week  I couldn t imagine having to cart around crowds in it but for one person who is usually on their own it s a great choice  I can t say enough about this car  It came with every option I wanted  and many more I didn t want but are nice to have  including anti lock brakes  an alarm  keyless entry  and a cd player  I haven t had it very long but have already become a fan over this short time and recommend it highly br br  
 Five years and 100 000 miles  my Safari is still keeping on  The big  goofy van is a mammoth compared to other minivans  but that is what I like about it  In fact  it has more interior room than my neighbor s Suburban  but his truck rides a lot better The Safari has always been a vehicle of compromises  It has more room than a Suburban  but doesn t ride as nice  It is less costly than a Caravan  but not nearly as state of the art  My Safari is equipped to tow up to 5500 lbs  but I wouldn t feel confident to tow anything over 3000 lbs  for fearing of breaking something My relationship with the Safari started when I bought it new in Fremont  CA  I traded in my Honda because I needed a vehicle to tow my newly purchased tent trailer  What originally impressed me was the style  I like the custom vans of the 70 s  maneuverability   compared to a full size van  and no way I was going to pay  30K for a new 4X4 Blazer  my wife s initial pick of tow vehicles  The optional rear air conditioning is what swayed my wife s opinion to my side  This was my first American made vehicle I have ever purchased  I have previously owned a Honda Civic  Mitsubishi pick up  and Toyota pick up  Each of which I put 100 000 miles on and traded in for a new vehicle Life in California was grand with the big van  We went on countless camping trips with the tent trailer  as far as the state of Washington  the Sierras  and California s mid coast  Though I never used it for commuting  motorcycles rule for that  the first 20K miles went by with a nary a hitch  Everything worked flawlessly Then I got orders to Maine I loaded my van up to the ceiling with stuff  hooked up my tent trailer  and off we went  We arrived in Maine in Nov  98  With not a lot of snow driving experience  I was a little nervous about driving a 2wd vehicle with no limited slip differential  I found out something though  Yes  you can drive a non four wheel drive vehicle in the snow  In fact  the Safari does quite well  4500lbs equally distributed over the wheels works well  BF Goodrich T A radials work well here too  Granted  I was never off roading in the Allagash  but I always made it work and Shop and Save when I had too  And if the snow was too bad  wait 30 minutes till the snow plow guys clear the road  Maine is one state that is on top of snow removal  Winter weather and frost heaved gravel roads took a toll on the van  A loose snow chain took a chunk of molding off rear left quarter panel  Donner Pass  CA  actually  The windshield took lots of chips and pits from flying rocks and sand  So did the paint  Little dings arouse all around the body from wayward shopping carts  other people s car doors  falling tree branches  and so forth  My wife even dropped my motorcycle onto the front fender  making a nice little dent  The inside took abuse too  with two kids and all their spills and maladies  trash runs to the dump  no trash service where I live in Maine  snow  mud  rain  and various furniture and other items I moved into and out of the new house  Overall  the van took all the abuse in stride  with very little rust to show for all the new scratches it received The frost heaved roads were murder on us though  My wife hated going down the road in the van  and let me know it every chance she got  The kids loved all the bouncing and swaying the van was doing  I replaced the shocks with Monroe Sensatracs gas in the front and Monroe Load Levelers in the rear  That helped a bit  but still far from smooth  Now my wife doesn t complain about it much  but maybe she just accepts the lousy roads in Maine  I swear by the Load Levelers  That is one mod I should have done that from the beginning  Along with the harsher conditions  came some interesting mechanical problems  On hot  humid days  the transmission would start to shift from first to second with a jolt  like a swift kick actually  I found out I could easily remedy this problem by turning off the ignition when I came to a stop light and count  one potato  two potato  three  Once I turned the vehicle back on it would shift smoothly  This usually occurs when the van was driven for about an hour or so  On warmer days  this occurs more frequently  On cold days  it doesn t happen at all  I ve talk to some transmission specialists in Portland  and their guess was that it was a computer fault in the transmission that occurs when it is hot  and it resets itself when you kill power to the ignition  Another guess from an auto parts store guy was that I needed a whole new transmission  just like the one he rebuilt in his Chevy Silverado  The guess I liked best was from the service manager at GMC  He suggested that I needed new transmission fluid  So I replaced the fluid last January  The van ran great until it warmed up in June  Hmmm  The service manger s second guess is that I needed to replace a service valve in the transmission  The transmission builds pressure to shift at higher road speeds  If the valve sticks when I come to a stop  it will shift at a higher pressure between first and second gear  thus causing the jolt  I haven t replaced the valve yet  since I have other problems with the Safari to deal with at the moment  and Maine summers only last about two months anyway  Another problem that was more apparent to us inside the van was the lack of freon in the A C  I discovered this on a trip to Disney World last November  I had the air conditioning serviced in January when we got back  I learned a valuable lesson then  Never have your A C serviced in 10 degree temperatures  It might have worked when I drove off the lot that day  but there is no way I could tell  I did discover that it still didn t work in June  I went back to the dealer to get a  450 a c coolent hose replaced  Ouch  It is expensive to be cool Those are my two biggest complaints I have with the van  Another complaint I have is that a  Service Engine Soon  light comes on frequently  I replaced an oxygen sensor  but the light still comes on  I brought the van back to GMC  and the mechanic reset the computer so it would ignore a fault code when the catalytic converter doesn t warm up in the required time  That worked for a while  but now the light still comes on infrequently  It doesn t affect the performance of the van  so I ll take it back when I have more money to throw away  More nit picks that I have had with the van  A light that went out in the instrument cluster and was expensive to replace A side door handle that would not release the door when it was fully open from the outside  An oil leak  an idler arm out of tolerance  and rear brake pads my dealer loves to replace  Also  the driver side window motor died  and the wipers needed a computer chip to keep functioning  Overall  I ve shelled out a lot of cash to keep this beast running  Compared to my other vehicles  the Safari is a maintenance nightmare  None of my other vehicles required anything other than routine maintenance Thankfully  I still like the van  otherwise I wouldn t have spent the money  The Safari is a niche vehicle  It is the only mid size van left on the market  Though cheaper than its mini van rivals  it gets my vote because it tows a lot  has a lot of room  and drives better than a full size van  I wish the people at GMC who slapped it together during production  would have care for it as much I do  So in that sense  I feel left down  
 History  I purchased this automobile at 6K and have driven it on paved to gravel roads  Most of the miles on this car have been highway  I have replaced two unrelated engine sensors in the 60K I have driven it  These two sensors were backed up in the programming and did not disable the car before I took it to the shop  Look and Feel  This automobile is more stylish than the GM equivalents that I was comparing it to at the time  update your car interiors GM  and I have not been too impressed with my previous ownership encounters of Dodge and Chrysler products  Has a smooth ride and handles good for a larger car  It is very comfortable and it didn t feel like I was riding on the ground like some of the Honda  Subaru  or sporty autos  Economy  The car averages 23 25 MPG on the highway  but does prefer the higher octane 89 and can ping under load on hills when driving slow back roads using 87 octane  Body Integrity  Body is still in great shape and the paint still has a good finish  Wiper arms were frozen one winter and were a problem  The wiper bolt will not keep arm fixed on the shaft  This part has aluminum splines and sheered off never to work properly again without modification or replacement  Final Comments  It has made for some comfortable 10 hour trips for four people numerous times  However the weight of the full trunk of luggage and the two people  small people in the back seat is a bit too much for the rear suspension  On some sharp quick inclines the car bottoms out on the springs and is that is not very comforting Recommendation  I will buy this auto in the future when I need another 4 door sedan br br  
 We have been driving a custom conversion van for years  Our Dodge was getting old  when looking for a new van  it was difficult to find a conversion package that we liked  The Ford E150 with the Starcraft conversion package fit our needs  We bought the van and in our first year of use have put over 15 000 miles on it traveling the Southwest  The van has the 5 4 L Triton V 8  a good engine combination for the unit  We tow a trailer  normally loaded with a car  and this motor and drive train combination has no difficulties in the Southwest mountains  We have had no problems with the unit during our first year of use  It handles the heat well  no overheating and the AC keeps us comfortable in the large cabin  It is comfortable to drive  the kids enjoy the conversion features and it has been extremely reliable  The CONS  You can t drive with the front windows down  too much noise and wind input  Even with the windows closed  there is a lot of wind noise around the front doors  They could have a better seal Quick update  The brakes wore out ahead of where I would have thought  at 17 000 miles  There are no  quot tell tales quot  on the brake pads  so you know they are gone when the pad is gone and you are grinding metal on metal  I about wore out a front rotor real quick  If you do a lot of stop and go driving  get them checked regularly after 12 000 miles  I know in the future  I won t run a set of front pads past 15 000 miles  cheaper to change the pads than ruin the rotors     
 My husband and I test drove this vehicle on Memorial Day weekend  We also drove a Toyota ECHO  We bought the Echo  partly because of Toyota s reputation  partly because I liked the Echo better  The car we drove had the Zetec engine  It was peppy enough and the car took corners well  The car we drove had 5 000 plus miles on it  We had to stop to put fuel in it and noticed the smell of burning oil coming from the engine compartment  We opened the hood  but couldn t find the leak  however  after a 30 minute test drive the odor was still there Visibility forward and sideways is good  Rear visibility is not so good for backing up  Seats were fairly comfortable  but I did not like the way my foot was positioned on the pedals  Brakes worked fine in a panic stop  The trunk has lots of space  I sat in the back seat in a 3 Dr  It was very difficult getting in and out  so I recommend that if you are carrying passengers in the rear  buy a 4 door  Also even though it brings up the price of the car  get the Zetec engine Probably a decent car for the money  If you think you re buying American  most of the one s we looked at were built in Mexico br br  
 We recently purchsed this truck after years of driving a small to mid sized vehicle this was a huge change  But after having our 3rd baby we needed something to haul everyone around in  I am not a  mini van chick  I flat out refused to drive one so my husband and I started investigating the SUV s  After months of reading  talking and searching we decided on the Ford Expedition Im very please with it  I was a little worried about how I would handle a large vehicle but it is surprisingly easy to drive  parking is a wee but tight on occasion but so far I havent had a huge problem  We opted for the 4x2 XLT version  really no need for the 4x4 when driving to the super market and school  plus thats just one extra thing that could go wrong in the future  Ours has all the bells and whistles including the rear air  which is a great thing when you have 3 kids in the back  I was advised to get the  big  motor  the 5 4 liter but we ended up with the 4 6  which has PLENTY of power and is much easier on the gas bill  Though my husband claims he wants to put a super charger in it I think not  It has the 3rd row of seats which was a huge selling point for me  my children are now seperated and have zero reason to fight no more  MOM  he s touching me  it is so very peaceful and makes me much more relaxed nothing worse than a stressed mom behind the wheel The only down fall is that there isnt a whole lot of cargo space when the 3rd seat is in  We recently took a trip for the weekend  all of us  and it was packed to the hilt  especially since we have an infant and god knows they need so much equipment when away from home I would highly recommend this truck to anyone who wants the space of a mini van without the minivan look  
 The 2000 Ford Mustang GT is a car to be reckoned with  I purchased my Mustang at my local Ford dealer back in October  and I must say that I am totally and thoroughly satisfied The first thing one will notice when purchasing a new Mustang GT compared to earlier models is the significant jump in horsepower  the 1998 model had 225HP  while the 1999 and 2000 models have 260HP  over a 15  increase  The new Stang is very throttle responsive compared to previous models  I owned a 1996 Mustang GT  and it s tire barking ability is uncanny  with optional traction control toggled in the off position  for those rubber munchers out there  It s 0 60mph times in under 6 5 seconds will leave you very satisfied as you leave those unlucky people behind you when the traffic light turns green  Its new hard edge design is sure to get looks everywhere you go  it looks aggressive like the 5 0 s of lore  Be prepared to shell out some cash for gas however  this beast loves to drink the factory recommended 87 octane fuel  Overall quality is top notch  the new Mustang is quieter  feels like a luxury car in ride quality  yet maintains excellent handling in the turns  Comparisons  While the Mustang GT is not as powerful as GM s counterparts the Firebird TransAM or Formula  and the Chevrolet Camaro  it s quality exceeds those models by far  I think sales prove that  as those models will soon be a thing of the past If you are a person that likes horsepower  quality of ride  and just loves to drive  the 2000 Ford Mustang GT is for you  test drive one today at your local Ford Dealer br br  
 I recently purchased the 2000 Ford Focus  I am very impressed with the 16 valve 2 0 litre engine  The engine provides lots of power  There is plenty of room in the front and rear seats  My baby car seat fits comfortably in the rear seat  The console is attractively designed and has an original look  The LED display on the radio gives the time and station simultaneously  The manufacturer s CD and stereo system operate smoothly and provide decent sound  The car gets excellent gas mileage and performs well on the highway  It is convenient being able to access the trunk from the interior of the car  The windows and mirrors provide good 360 degree visibility  For first time car buyers  this is THE one  The price is reasonable for what you get  The car is inexpensive but has a luxury feel br br  
 I bought this vehicle for a couple of reasons  First living in Hawaii I needed a vehicle that won t collect rust  Second a vehicle that is reliable vehicle  Finally a vehicle that I can put to work and hauling things for people making a little extra money on the side  I have done just about every thong I my Ranger  I transport military parts for my job section all the time  All the people I work with like to drive it on the weekend when I m not doing anything  just because they like to go bike riding or atv riding  Well then if you are looking for a truck that is reliable and affordable then this is the truck for you br br  
 Note  This review is for the 2001 Lexus RX 300 4WD w navigation option I recently upgraded from a 1999 Lexus RX 300 to a 2001 Lexus RX 300 4WD Navigation model  It s silver gray with Black Leather interior  Luxury options include GPS navigation  heated seats  RDS Audio  Wood accented steering wheel and gear knob  and a new spoiler  Other extra and changes from the 1999 model include a full size spare tire  a larger 19 Gallon gas tank  a new front grill  a runner on the bumper in back  and yet ANOTHER cup holder that folds out from the middle of the back seat While the 1999 RX 300 was a great SUV  it had a few shortcomings that have been address in this the new 2001  Most notably the excessive wind noise from the sun roof has been considerably reduced and  in the navigation model  the Stereo Controls are much more intuitive  Other than that  it still drives and handles quite well in many conditions  And of course  for most of us  that simply means getting from point A to point B  Not necessarily off roading or sport driving  as one might expect from an SUV The navigation screen  while a bit small  provides all the feedback a user needs  Mapping  audio  maintenance schedule  and other car preferences  All available via touch screen Being GPS equipped the computer does an excellent job at knowing where you re at and which direction your going  I tested several different addresses in all kinds of obscure places and it always found them  Even if it s on the other side of the country  it only takes about 5 seconds to map out a route to your destination  You can specify a destination by exact street address  by intersection  or specific point of interest  such as  quot Golden Gate Bridge quot When it calculates a route  it gives your 3 choices depending on your set up options and desire to use freeways  or not  Once you chosen your route the computer will tell you to proceed to the spot shown on the screen  usually a very close by intersection  to start the trip The cool thing about the guide is that she s got a very pleasant voice and it s mixed right in with the audio  So if you re listening to the stereo or whatever  it ll just speak right over the music  You can adjust her volume if you listen to the music a little louder than normal As you approach turns and intersections  she will let you know which lane to be in and what to expect when you get there  For instance  if you exit on the right  but then need to immediately stay to the left AFTER the exit  she ll tell you that  This is accompanied by a overview of the upcoming intersection on the screen as well  This is very nice for driving at night or when it s hilly  so you understand the layout of what s coming up ahead If you decide to change your route or take a different exit  the computer will quickly re calculate a new route  and will continue to do so if you change your mind again  This is also true if you see a spot that you want to stop at as a Way Point  Just point to it with your finger and set it  and it ll calculate your route via that Way Point Should you find yourself hungry for Chinese food  simply press the POI  Point of Interest  button and you can have the display show you all the Chinese food places within the visible map area  POIs include  ethnic restaurants  ATMs  Gas Stations  and more  A real boon when traveling in an unfamiliar locale Another great feature is the addition of all the audio features to this touch screen command center  All the buttons for the CD Changer and Audio Settings are displayed here  One new feature is the addition of RDS to the stereo system  This Radio Data System picks up special signals sent out by some radio stations that include it s call letters  music genre  and emergency info  One touch of the RDS Scan button and it instantly finds all the RDS stations and you can  for instance  only display all the Easy Listening stations in your area  that are broadcasting RDS  mind you  This is an especially useful feature if you re in a new city and your don t know the radio stations  RDS also features a special  quot TRAF quot  feature which will automatically interrupt your CD Radio listen to give you important traffic and emergency updates along your route Maintenance scheduling is included on a separate screen so you can keep track of when you re due for the next oil change  air filter change  etc  You can even program it for Birthday reminders There are only a couple small interface issues I have with it  One being that you cannot access certain functions while the car is moving  This is obviously done for safety reason  since they don t want the driver searching for trivial information while driving  For instance  while driving you can change route information and set a way point  but you cannot set up a destination or specific address  If I m going on a long trip  I almost always have a companion with me in the car  and it would be nice if they could access the information while on the road  instead of having to pull off and stop Also  every time you start the car up the screen same something to the effect of   quot You agree not to operate this navigation system if it s unsafe quot  You have to press the  quot I agree quot  button on the screen before you can start using the system  Obviously  something installed to appease the lawyers  but does it have to ask EVERY time Over all  it s exactly the Luxury SUV that I was looking for  It s got the bells and whistles that I like  along with the safety features I need  And it s really fun to drive br br  
 I bought a year old 1996 Taurus Wagon  lease return  in December of 1996 and purchased the extended warranty offered by the dealer  The car had around 46 km on it when I got it  so I had original warranty plus extended  I have had few problems except for the transmission which was replaced under the warranty at no cost to me  Usual stuff   tires  brakes  not cheap as this car has disc brakes all around  this and that mostly covered by warranty  Replacing a sensor is a ridiculous expense in a modern car  nearly  300 to have the ENGINE NEEDS SERVICE SOON light not bug you  I rate this car highly as I was in a major accident  T boned  and both myself and my daughter were unharmed  on drivers side  Keeping cars running is a more and more expensive proposition  The car is full of features and is very convenient  I cross my fingers not to have major problems of this or that kind  I can surely empathize with the other reviewers  It is very expensive to repair major things in new cars  I remember when a tranny could be fixed for under a thousand  not nowadays  With respect to warranties  I had a bad experience with another car from a used car dealer offering a warranty from a firm which turned out to be part of the same group  The adjuster was always fighting to get parts cheaper  It was a real hassle  Dishonest and slimey  I suggest htat when you get a car  check out the dealer and see what kind of reputation they have  My dealer made sure that I got full value for my warranty  Sometimes they would do things for me without any charge if their service staff didn t inform me or did something that wasn t quite according to Hoyle  for example  not changing a brakelight bulb because they couldn t contact me for approval   that was a freebie done on the spot I don t know how the Taurus are going to work out in the long run  So far so good for me  Car manufacturers are nuts if they don t provide reasonable warranty coverage  and large firms such as GE Capital do themselves huge damage by not honouring warranties reasonably  I am always amazed at how these firms spend millions of dollars in advertising and promotion and then throw it away by treating people badly  They should take the good with the bad  profits on the overall way they work and eat the losses while looking after the customer  Would I buy a car again from my dealer  Absolutely  A Ford  Depends on the market and the quality  Taurus  so far so good     
 THIS CAR HAS BEEN TOTALED  Can you believe that our little Festiva has been the target of a hit and run  I will have the wreckage pictures availible on my car domain at  http members cardomain com psymo   It will be on page two or so We used to own a Korean made 1993 Ford  Kia  Festiva until a drunk person smashed the heck out of it  It is the next thing in the Ford sub compact line since the late Fiesta  The Festiva has a lot to offer  for a small car  It has the power that the Aspire lacks  I will present the advantages  disadvantages  and talk about some other comparable cars  There are many advantages to having a small car  You don t need to find a large parking space and if you ever need to have repairs done  they are cheap  It is so cheap in fact  that when the drunk guy hit it  the hatchback pushed in to the backseat  Also  the dash pieces fell off on the collision  One good point  The air conditioner is going in the Aspire  I am glad no one was in the car  it would have spelled doom for them  The inside of the car is large  Larger then you might think  but is not when drunk people rear end it and run away  It is large enough for four people  but not five  The rear seat gets way too crowded with three people  It is not a good family car  but works great for one  It really is like the Fiesta in many ways  This car has given us Five years of dependability and use  Thank You Festiva The Festiva is just like the New Yugo Korrel  Never made it to US  in that it seems that the labels are the only things that are different  The Festiva s 1 3 Litre 63 horsepower engine is similar to the Ford Aspire s  Also made by Kia in Korea  but is a little more powerful  There were two types of Festivas  the standard and the GL  One had Mag Wheels and other features such as Air conditioning All in out  the Festiva is a good small car for one  not the entire family  So I give it Five out of Five stars  
 After getting burned on my last vehicle purchase  I spent a year researching vehicles  It came down to the Honda CR V  Subaru Forester or Legacy Outback  I loved the Outback but just had to get over the station wagon stigma  Let me just say flat out that this is NOT your father s Country Squire  It s just like Paul Hogan states in the commercials  Driving the Subaru Outback is like hopping into a rally car  The car is really fun to drive in the pouring rain or during a blizzard  no joke  I went cheap and got a metallic silver base model with a CD player and cold weather package as the only options This car is a true  quot sport utility quot  vehicle  You get great handling and cornering thanks to the low mounted H 4 engine  The ride height is perfect and the driver s seat can be height adjusted to give you a commanding view of the road  The 4 cylinder may not be a powerhouse but it still has an impressive 165hp and a much better power to weight ratio than most SUV s  If you want a sports sedan but need the room and utility of a truck  this is the vehicle for you since you can opt for a great 5 speed manual transmission  This vehicle sips gas when compared to a 2 ton SUV and the braking with the 4 wheel discs and ABS is great  If any of you have owned an SUV with  quot part time quot  4WD  you will greatly appreciate Subaru s AWD system  All wheel drive is vastly superior for the type of conditions most people face on the road  Leave 4x4 for the off roaders The cons  Well  there aren t many  The seats are a bit firm  I ve driven about 5 hours nonstop but I don t mind firm seats  The way the outback roof is raised  it makes it impossible to get a power sunroof  as well br br  
 I have owned my Focus now for a little over 3 months and I love it  You know on those commercials they show the family going over  I think it was railroad tracks  and the grandmother is holding a cup of tea and it did not spill  Well  it did not lie my focus has enough shock protection to go through the deepest potholes with ease  Now I know a lot of people have these biases against owning a Ford and so did I until I drove this car  it handled so smooth and nice and the gas milage is outstanding  I can drive almost 400 miles before I have to fill up again  which is nice when my job is driving all around town  This car is definely economical and sturdy I also found that unlike most compact cars  this Focus is very roomy  I am a very tall girl   5 11  and I don t even touch the roof  I have plenty of room for my giant legs and feet to move around which is suprising for me since mine is manual transmission  The trunk is also huge and can fit 4 regualr size tires in it  The Focuses also come with an excellent bumper to bumper warrenty as well as nice rebates and insentive packages  The car is also a very competive price  My Focus cost me a little over  11 000 after rebates and it is fully loaded with every little feature you need  Child locks  airbags  power windows and locks  tilt steering  power steering  cruise control and climate control  heated seats and much more  now I don t know a lot about car  I won t lie to you  but I feel like I got a great deal on my car and it is perfect for me and my life syle  
 The Ford Econoline van was not only a mechanics worst nightmare but also the owners  This van had numerous problems including severe break problems and an overall rough ride from light suspension  The brakes had to be replaced at least every four months and the suspension seamed to always  quot bottom out quot  and not provide enough suspension for even the regular trip around town  Sure this van was nice for carrying people and cargo but mechanical problems put this van on the bottom of my list  So if your looking for a van out there I believe that you should shop around some more and definatly not look in to the Ford Econoline van unless your up for a rough ride and spending money on brakes every four months  I really do not recommend this van to anyone  The ride was horrible  it got about ten miles to the gallon on gas  and used up your money in many other ways br br  
 This is a perfect work truck  The first thing that comes to mind when someone ask s me about this truck is the torque  and horsepower  with the manual transmission you can tow just about anything  ATV s  Campers  fifth wheel trailers  all kinds of loads  As far as the cab goes it s very roomy for anyone unless your eight feet tall  One thing that isn t so great about this truck is when they break down they break down good it s usually an expensive trip to the shop  If it s gas mileage your lookin for this isn t the Truck for you because the power comes at a price because even on the highway the gas needle falls pretty fast  all in all though if your lookin for a good powerful work truck I highly recommend this br br  
 We all hate the process of going to buy a new car  but we just love driving them  The Chrysler Cirrus is the car I have chosen and have nothing but great things to say about it  The LXI version comes with leather interior and all the bells and whistles  It is a very sporty  yet incredibly comfortable ride  The four door model outshines most of the sportier 2 door models out there  If you are feeling lucky buy it in black but be prepared to spend more at the carwash than you did at the dealership  For under  20 000 it is a great bargain  leaving my friends in their more expensive foreign cars very jealous br br  
 I have driven a wide variety of cars in my life but none have as much of a storied history as the Impala SS  Many baby boomers will remember the SSes of the  60s with big  honkin  motors  e g  409 cid  and the tire melting acceleration Well  let s fast forward to 1994  the year Chevrolet decided to bring the Impala SS out of hibernation  When I first saw the concept vehicle at an Auto Show  I drooled  Period  Although this car shared a lot of with the Caprice 9C1 it was based on  tit had the aggressive appearance that I loved  didn t help it was in my favorite color   Black  The front end of the car could be summed up in one word   menacing  The grille design lent a lot to the aggressive appearance as well as the taillight treatment and the subtle spoiler  The 17  ROH ZR6 rims added a little panache to the vehicle  Driving one of these beasts will definitely take you back to the muscle car era  The 260 hp LT 1 gives the car enough thrust to take out quite a few V 8 powered vehicles  The transmission gives crisp  decisive shifts while handling the 330 ft lbs of torque this car puts down In one test drive  I actually lit the tires up on a few main streets  accidentally  Another advantage is that these motors have enough aftermarket support that you could easily turn one of these cars into a serious beast As for the interior  I found myself with enough room to be comfortable  However  I liked the floor mounted shifter  versus tree mounted in 1994 95  and the analog gauges  versus digital in 1994 95  Other than that  there was really nothing spectacular about the interior of the SS But with that much go under foot  who cares The steering on these cars will definitely not remind you of a BMW 7 series but it does track pretty well for a 4300  pound boulevard basher  However  the steering is pretty responsive  again due to its 9C1 influence  and the handling is pretty decent because of the 9C1 underpinnings and the meaty 255 50 17 tires However  the challenge with the cars now is trying to find one that is in good shape or hasn t been modded to oblivion Another issue with these cars  like the 2000 2003 Nissan Maxima  is trying to find the tires  The size is not common among manufacturers and many owners have been forced to go to 275 40 17 or a more common size Despite that  the car is still enjoyable to drive around town and has enough cajones to win the stoplight grand prix  
 I ve owned three 1993 Probe GT s  My first  I bought in 1995 with 32 000 miles on the clock  never gave me a minutes problem right up to the point when it was totalled in April of 2000 with 151 000 miles  It was still on it s original clutch  which has just begun slipping on hard launches  a few weeks before  The five speed has amazing power for a 2 5 liter V6  I d get plenty of compliments on how good the car looked  and no one believed it was 7 years old with over 100 000 miles  After that  I bought a new Mustang  but missed the more corner hungry handling of the Probe  so I found another one  this one with a few more miles  and not in as good of condition  but it was all I could afford along with Mustang payments  This one had 113 000 miles on it  and although I would never normally buy a car with mileage that high  I figured it could be too bad  I was right  I replaced two oxygen sensors for a total cost of  150  and that was all I ever did to it  Someone offered me more than double what I d paid for it a few months later  so I obviously couldn t turn that down  so I sold it and immediately bought a black 93 which I currently have  It s got 86 000 miles on it  and hasn t given me any problems so far  but it s only been about 8 months that I ve had it  On my first Probe  routine maintenence costs an arm and a leg  My 60 000 and 120 000 mile service both cost me well over  600 each  and were basically nothing more than timing belt  serpentine belt  and water pump replacements  along with filters  etc  Overall  it s a great car I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone looking for a fun  practical  inexpensive to buy car  
 Well now  everyone in the world knows that the USA is a very wealthy country  Not only that  it is well known that every United States citizen owns a Cadillac Armed with that one piece of certain knowledge  my good  well she was then  wife and I spent three weeks in the good  ol USA back in 1978  We knew we had to rent a Cadillac so we wouldn t look too out of place but oh  the shame Our first night was in San Francisco  so once we got the hotel room organised for our three day stay there  down the elevator we go heading for the car rental station right next door  As we stepped onto the footpath  er sorry sidewalk  as expected a Cadillac came up the street and parked right in front of us Out jumped a tiny petite little Asian American who had managed to steer this humungus thing up the road somehow  and even to park it  And right there is my shame  because this little  ol Caddy was about the size of a 160 foot  150 ton Road Train back home  I knew right then and there I could never manoeuvre that much steel through San Francisco s windy streets  and yet she could So we settled for a Camaro  singularly unimpressive but it did the job Anyway  on my recent trip I was delighted to find they had taken a chainsaw to the Caddy  No problem this time The current model 2001 Cadillac Seville is only 201 inches long  not a whole lot longer than the average family sedan in the land downunder  Amazing what twenty two years can do  They no longer look like a giant beef burger either   with clean crisp styling this is now a real motor vehicle rather than a Sherman tank I managed a rental for three days from Avis for  275  pretty good really for a vehicle of this calibre The bloke at the rental station said she was worth about 45 000 clams and that it runs on gas  Well I can tell you they don t   oh no  its petrol  I tried for half an hour to get the autogas nozzle inserted   very very frustrating Why must the yanks get so confused   must be the pollution That aside the Caddy SLS 4 door sedan is a tribute to the car builders in Detroit  The ride is ultra comfortable for five people  The double overhead camshaft V8 engine is quiet and unobtrusive and puts out a creditable three hundred horsepower at six thousand revs  pretty good for a little 4 6 litre  With 300 pounds of torque at a fairly leisurely four thousand revs  this four thousand pound steed gives a creditable performance at an inexpensive seventeen to twenty six miles per gallon  The 15 7 cubic feet of stowage space is ample for most needs I had a little read of the comprehensive manual  I discovered all manner of mostly useless junk that is all the rage in this type of vehicle  I quote  Cadillac s standard OnStar system has been updated  including Personal Calling capability  which allows drivers to make personal hands free telephone calls without additional cellular equipment  and the OnStar Virtual Advisor  This system will deliver personalised internet based information such as news headlines  sports scores  stock quotes  and weather information  A new optional audio system  Infotainment with Bose  integrates complete full function color map based navigation with radio  CD ROM  compact flash memory  and audio playback  Features include E mail capability  cell phone integration  and voice memo recorder  all hands free in operation I guess some of that could be useful in a car  but I am far more interested in the comfort  performance and ease of operation   all areas where the Cadillac shines  Being cocooned in two tons of steel gives the main nut behind the wheel a real feeling of security  as I worked my way between countless lesser vehicles the Americans apparently use to preserve their own Cadillacs  Quite interesting how most of these people left their main machine at home That feeling of security is further enhanced by Driver and Passenger  Depowered  Air Bags plus Side Impact Air Bags   StabiliTrak 2 0  and a self leveling suspension system  I am usually anti front wheel drive but on the Cadillac it seems to be no problem   perhaps due to the weight Other features include Auto On Delay Off headlights   Interlock Cruise Speed ControlTransmission  Rainsense Automatic Speed Control Wipers  Automatic Climate Control  Dual Zone Air Filtration System  4 Speed Electronically Controlled Automatic with overdrive and big 16 inch Cast Aluminum Wheels It all works superbly to give a ride and comfort level fitting of any Epinions author And speaking of comfort  the interior features an Outside Temperature Gauge  Power Outlet s  Radio Controls on the Steering Wheel  Driver and front passenger Power Lumbar Supports  Power Reclining Leather Bucket Seats  Leather Shift Knob and Steering Wheel and all windows are electric with an Express Up   Down feature What a machine  Cruising down the freeway I am totally absorbed in  my  Caddyshack  as I sing away  Sugarshack  oh yea  you re my sugarshack  Pity they are the only words I know so it does become a little repetitive  but there is nothing to disappoint in this people mover   move over peasants  I m coming through This was the one  the only  chunk of metal I did not want to return  If I could have taken it home I surely would  but then I must admit I haven t even driven the Aussi equivalents   regardless I don t believe cars come any better than this Any Americana who hasn t got one would have to be a mug  fair dinkum  At least I know now why they all have Actually  come to think of it  maybe I m the mug  because the Australian equivalent is about the same price hhmmm 
 I have a 1996 2 door Cavalier  I bought it new and have loved every mile travelled in it  I have not had a single mechanical problem with it  I am diligent about getting the oil checked  so maybe that makes a difference For those of you with winter woes  this little car handles EXTREMELY WELL in bad weather  The all weather tires do just fine in the upstate New York blizzards  The gas mileage is between 23 29 miles per gallon  Mine is 4 1 2 years old and already has 85K miles  Yet  no unscheduled maintenance has been necessary  Brake pads were replaced once  All Chevy s come with 24 hr roadside assistance  which is comforting to know even though I have been fortunate and have not needed it The only regret I have with my purchase was not ordering the car with power windows     
 I bought my 2001 Cobra in January 2003  I missed the power after selling my modified 1991 Mustang GT a couple of years ago  My Cobra had 13 000 miles on it  so  it was practically new  I was impressed with the power of the Cobra and the brakes  However  I had problems with my Cobra  There was what some call  driveline slop  when shifting  There would always be a loud clunking noise coming from the rear of the car  Eventually  there was a big  bang  one day and it turns out my rear differential failed  There were problems with the warranty repair but that s another story  See note at end  After getting the car back it drove better   Driveline slop  was gone  I was happy until a month later  when the rear axle bearings went out and needed to be towed back home  The car has left me stranded twice and it only now has 27 000 miles on it  The axle was repaired under warranty and now I will sell the car as soon as possible  I will not keep this car past the warranty period There are other things I should mention like the drivers s seat shifting during some cornering and the front bumper is loose  You can move it up and down with your hands  The Ford dealership says this is  normal  I don t think so The overall quality of the interior is kind of cheap looking with lot s of plastic  The shifter console is loose around the shifter  Just overall low quality  Looks like Ford just built a piece of crap car around a good engine and brakes  Note to anyone considering buying a used car from a Ford dealership  If the car is still under mfgr s warranty  have the dealership print you out a copy of the vehicle s  OASIS  report  That s the Ford vehicle info database  It shows all repairs done at Ford dealerships and it shows the vehicles warranty status  This could become important later  
 The thing about Fords is that you either love them  or hate them  There really seems to be no middle ground  I had always drove GM vehicles all my life  up until my truck that is  About 3 years ago I sold my car and I wanted a truck  I bought a 2 year old  95 F 150 XL  To be honest  the XL was and to my knowledge is the work truck model  quite utilitarian  It came equipted with vinyl floors  no carpeting  This worked out for me as I take my truck to the lake an aweful lot  and camping  This way I can wash all the mud and dirt off the floor with little effort  Also standard was a bench seat  Not my idea of style  but hey  it isn t that bad  It doesn t offer great support  but it is comfortable enough to do your driving from point A to point B  My vehicle is a regular Cab model Ford had done an excellent job in making the  95 F 150 more car like than it s competition of the time  It has  quot Car like quot  side mirrors  Also  the dash is stylish  not the boxy  cheap looking dashes found in the Chev and Dodge back then  While that really isn t tops on my shopping list  the fact that the dash included a full range of gauges was a nice touch  The only thing excluded was the tach  but then again  my truck is an automatic  so it really isn t an issue  Also a nice feature is the automatic overdrive  It can be disable by the touch of a button nicely integrated at the end of the gear shift  This comes in handy for hauling heavy loads  so you don t damage your automatic transmission The F 150 s of  95 came with 3 engines  The V6 is underpowered and gets negligable fuel economy improvements over the 5 0L V8  302  I have a 302 in my truck  It has enough power and torque to haul some heavy loads  I have had 1900lbs   in the back of the truck  and never any problems  Also available is a 5 8L V8  This engine provides even more power and torque  The 5L has been more than enough for my suburban needs  It has been ultra reliable  only requiring oil changes  and a rad flush since I bought it  It also has started flawlessly in the cold Manitoba Winters  I have had the vehicle start after sitting 20 hours in  40 degree Celcius weather  with out having the block heater plugged in Exterior styling is pleasant to the eye  I have seen the extended cab model of this truck  and it looks great too  There are many of these vehicles on the road  as they are North Americas top selling vehicle  So finding parts is easy too  I recently replaced the standard matte finish grill and headlight bezels with the chrome ones off an XLT model I found at the auto recker  that had been in an accident  If I had to find a fault with the exterior of this vehicle it is the paint  I know Ford has had problems in the past  and for the most part the finish of my vehicle is fabulous  But the paint seems softer than what I was accustomed to with my GM Vehicles  It didn t take more than a little rub up against my fence with the truck door  and I left a little mark  On the negative side of things  the engine noise is loud in the cabin  And the ride is choppy  But hey  this is a truck  remember  I once again site the paint quality  but maybe that is just a personal thing  Also  interior build quality is not what one would expect to see in a sedan  The large  quot plasticy quot  glove box in my truck looks cheap  Over all  this has been a fabulous vehicle for me  It looks and rides great  It also has been trouble free br br  
 After researching different types of small to mid sized cars earlier this year  I decided that the Ford Focus was definitely the type of car I wanted for myself  It was only a little bigger than my old car  a 1989 Dodge Omni  it had a ton of fun new features  and it seemed pretty reliable from the information I could find on the Internet about it  So  after applying for a new car loan from my bank  and finding the Focus I wanted from Carmax s website  I went in and bought myself a new car P P I was excited  I had all these new features  and a bigger engine to play with  My car came stocked with power windows  power door locks  AM FM radio  a CD player  and the new Ztech engine we had heard about  I was very proud of this shiny new car  showed it off to everyone where I worked  took my friends and family on test drives to show how great this car was  and recommended Focuses and Carmax to everyone P P And then  the first problem hit  Almost a week after we bought the car  on the way home from work  the check engine light came on  When I pulled into Carmax  I was brushed off by the service department there  and told that they wouldn t be the ones fixing the problem  it was still under Ford s 30 000 mile warranty  I was surprised to hear that  as when I bought the car  I bought it with Carmax s MaxCare warrantly as I ve had my other cars in for service there  and have been very pleased with the level of service  I was unaware that there was any warranty under Ford  I didn t even know American car companies offered them  but figured the people at Carmax knew what they were doing  and had them call up our local Ford dealer in Leesburg  VA  The next day when I picked up the car from Jerry s Leesburg Ford  I was told that a sensor had blown  that they replaced it and everything should be fine  They were right for about three months that is     Our first sign of trouble occurred on September 11  2002 when I was driving my husband back from his eye doctor appointment in Reston  VA  We were driving home  and the transmission seemed to slip  Having driven an old car for most of my life  I just thought it was a normal thing and brushed it off  but that weekend it got worse  After going to our local mall on Saturday  September 14th  the car decided to throw us for another loop  As we were driving down the road  the transmission started slipping again  more violently this time  and the interior and exterior lights started to flicker on and off  We got the car home as soon as we could  given the traffic around our area  and the next day took it out for a test drive  since Carmax   the dealer would not be open again until Monday morning  to see if we could pin down what was causing the problem  We drove it for about 30 minutes  so that the car would be warmed up  and then as we were driving by WorldCom in Ashburn  the problem started again  We hadn t done anything to cause a problem  but slam on the brakes when a bird flew out in front of the car     The next morning  this would be Monday  September 16th  we took the car to Carmax again as they still had not sufficiently explained this unknown Ford warranty to us  Again  we were told to go to the Ford dealer as Carmax wouldn t touch it  So  I called into work telling them I would be late  and we went over to the Koons Ford in Sterling  VA to drop the car off  I got a call from them later that afternoon telling me that the service technicians were unable to find any problems with the car and could we please come in for a test drive the following morning  So  my husband and I got up extra early that Tuesday  this would be September 17th  and went on a rather lengthy test drive with the technician  and still the problem did not occur again  At this point  the technicians were being extremely helpful  and said that if we didn t mind having extra miles put on the car  the technician would drive it to and from his home in Front Royal that evening to see if it occurred during his drive  The next morning  still nothing was found  and we were forced to pick up the car that afternoon with no resolution P P  Surprisingly though  the car behaved alright for the next couple of days  and didn t exhibit any more signs of failing until Saturday  September 21st when the car started doing the same things it had done to us on Saturday  September 14th  except that it was also making the gages on the dash go up and down making it look like we were doing 120 mph at a stop light  Luckily for us  the Koons Ford service department was still open that Saturday afternoon  so we drove the car in as it was breaking down so they could visibly see what it was doing  The service department at Koons took the car in right away  and about a half hour later  we were told that the car s alternator was dead  So  we waited until about 5 30 p m  as we were promised they would have the car all fixed up by the close of business that afternoon  and went to go visit Matt in the service department  He told us that the car wasn t finished yet  and offered to give us a loaner so we would have transportation until we could pick the car up on Monday P P  We picked up the car Monday morning  and it drove wonderfully until Friday  September 27th  I was driving with my husband to our local Enterprise car rental agency  so we could pick up a rental car for that weekend for a family get together  when the check engine light came on in the car again  Clearly upset  I drove the car back to Koons Ford that morning and demanded they fix the car this time  They took the car in  and later I was told that another sensor in the engine had blown  but it was fixed  I picked up the car on September 30th  and again the car seemed fine for awhile  and then it started doing the same thing it had been doing back when this whole thing started     On Friday  October 25th  on the way home from my husband s oral surgery  the car s transmission started slipping  the interior and exterior lights blinked on and off  and all the gages on the dash shot up and then went back down to normal  Since my husband was still somewhat sedated  I decided to wait until the next morning to take the car to Koons Ford  That Saturday  I took the car in and told them to call me when they had it fixed  About 4 00 p m  on Saturday  October 27th  we received a call from the dealer telling us that what was wrong was a loose ground wire and they fixed it and the car was ready for pick up  It sounded plausible  so we piled into one of our friend s cars  as my husband could still not drive yet  and picked up the car P P  Again  the car drove ok for awhile  I ran into a little difficulty on Wednesday  October 30th on my way to the National Zoo from work while I was sitting in traffic on the Beltway  but I thought it was just my imagination  and tried to convince myself that the car could not be breaking down again after all of that  Well  there s only so much you can brush off because on Saturday  November 9th  the car started exhibiting the same exact signs as before  And as before  we drove it straight back to Koons Ford in Sterling to be fixed  I just got a message on my voicemail at work this morning that they can t find anything wrong with the car  but they will check again today  and see if anything shows up     So  my shiny new car that I was so proud of back in May has turned into my worst nightmare  This is unfortunately not the first time I ve had this kind of trouble  I had a 1995 Dodge Intrepid that cost us a lot of money in repairs  but this Focus only has 23 000 miles on it  I can t even imagine what horrors await me when it hits 50 000     I would only recommend the 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 to someone who doesn t plan on driving it much or who wants to learn how to fix some of these newer cars  This car has proven to be very unreliable for people who need a reliable car to drive to and from work and take care of their family  The car looks great  and when it works  it drives like a dream  but who buys a car to have it in the shop all the time  
 After test driving a Toyota Rav4  Honda CRV EX  Ford Explorer  Toyota 4Runner  Subaru Forester and Ford Escape  I bought the Escape I wanted something small but still able to get off road and the Explorer and 4Runner were good vehicles  but just not for me The Toyota had very good creature features and a quiet ride  but the rear leg room was non existant and it had a weak motor going up hill  3200rpm up a 7  grade at 55mph  Also  seemed overpriced  The Honda had very good creature features  even a table for lunch  good rear leg room  However  the rear tailgate was very difficult to open when the vehicle was facing downhill  The tree stick shift seemed to be in an strange position  And again the engine was weak going up hill  3400rpm up a 7  grade at 55mph  This was my second choice The Escape V6 is a solid performer  I live at 6500 feet and that power comes in handy  It took the 7  grade at 55mph pulling 2400rpm  I liked the fact that you could control the 4x4 with the override switch on the dash board  The read tailgate has a window lift or gate lift  The rear leg room is good  not as good as the Honda  The CD Tape stereo has a better sound then the Honda and I have a lot of tapes  I recently took a trip with 4 men with 70lb backpacks each in the Escape and we were actually passing people on the highway going uphill  We made it up to the top of the Pacific Crest trail near the Elephants Back in low 4 wheel drive without a hitch  My gas mileage has been very good  about 24mpg in average driving conditions  freeway mileage is even better My only regret is the fact that I got the XLS not the XLT  I think Ford should put the automatic transmission on the floor instead of the column and Ford should offer a V6 manual transmission option Be careful when going to Ford dealers  the dealer I did business with was not reputable  
 A year and a half ago I purchased a used Jimmy  a 1994 LE to be exact  Because I got such a terrific deal on an excellent used car  I feel the need to tell everyone I know just exactly how GREAT of a deal I got  Anyone in the market for a used SUV  should take at look at GMC s Jimmy  Perhaps not as easy to find as the Ford Explorer  but they are usually offered at significant savings I bought my 1994 for  11 000 and it only had 26 000 miles  It was in immaculate condition  looking as if no one had ever even sat in the seats  The LE addition comes with all the bells and whistles   electric windows and door locks  rear defogger and rear wipers and a sound system that rivals anything I ve ever heard and THIS is the sound system that comes with the car  My husband  who owns a 1998 Altima is the music buff of the family and he is very jealous of my sound system I am a hockey coach and have put an additional 20 000 miles on my Jimmy  most of it carrying kids and a ton of hockey gear  I have all the room I need and with the back seat down  I have more room than I will ever need  It takes only one hand to put the rear seat down and is easy and simple enough to do that my 10 year can do it by herself  This is the most comfortable car for long drives that I have ever owned  After 4 hours behind the wheel in route to a hockey tournament  I don t feel  quot cramped quot  or  quot stiff quot  at all  I feel like I ve sat in my easy chair watching television If your in the market for a good used SUV  the Jimmy can be a real bargain br br  
 I ve been keeping track of the opinions posted around this car  Everyone s done a great job of posting the stats  and giving a good overview of nearly all aspects of this car  including the driving but I wanted to focus on the area in which this car excels b having the living daylights beaten out of it   First  I ll deal with the   things to consider i  list presented by Epinions when writing reviews  since this is my first post b 1  Did it live up to your expectations b cleans up the puddle of drool  It did when I bought it  It did when I crossed through the break in period  and it s doing it 11 450 miles later b 2  Who should buy or avoid this product b People who should NOT buy  anyone who will be driving primarily on poorly maintained roads  dirt roads  consistently wet roads  or in areas with a lot of snow  anyone looking to carry more than a single passenger  anyone looking to carry heavy loads  or bulky items  anyone looking to carry a young child as a passenger  anyone whose weight  with passenger  exceeds approx 430lbs  exact figure published in owners manual  anyone who doesn t anticipate driving with the top down very much  There are plenty of good hardtops which would be better suited  anyone who isn t comfortable handling a manual transmission  anyone who loves to have tons of torque  such that it doesn t matter what rpm they change gears at People who SHOULD buy  anyone interested in a high performance car with sharp handling  anyone willing to drive the car at high rpm to extract the best performance b 3  Why did you buy this car b I live in the Bay Area  a place with some interesting roads  excluding the choked freeways  and great weather  I d always wanted to try a convertible  and I wanted something which could stick to the road like a like a big sticky thing And now the  DRIVING   As tacky as it seems  the big  red START button really kicks off the experience for me  I put the top down  roll out of the garage  don the sunglasses and head off For the first 10 minutes or so  I don t like to exceed about 4500 rpm  The owners manual basically says you shouldn t push the car too hard while the engine is cold cold  meaning less than 3 temp bars on the gauge The car is perfectly civilized and doesn t handle like a brick at low rpm as some people have implied on the discussion boards Once the engine temp is right  though oh baby    I like to take Skyline Blvd  a long  windy road with towering trees on either side  When there s moisture in the air  you can see individual beams of light pushing through the trees  You feel the air becoming cooler and fresher as you climb higher and further away from the rest of the world  Note  this is during the weekdays around 2pm if you attempt this on the weekend  the whole world seems to have the same idea and will be driving in a convoy at 28 mph in front of you I like to take in the atmosphere a little and enjoy the sound of the engine before really pushing the car  where your mind becomes more focused on surviving the next corner  rather than watching the scenery  At these speeds  and in this state of mind  you can see  smell and otherwise sense so many things that you d miss if you were driving in anything other than a convertible Ok we ve been cruising for about 5 mins  the engine s warm the driver s warm b let s rock   We re probably doing around 40 45 mph in 3rd  or maybe 4th with nobody else in sight  we drop into 2nd  The engine pipes up to around 6000 rpm Here  the engine takes on an entirely different personality  It s not just louder  the tone is completely changed  That s VTEC for you  The engine has changed its timing from quiet and fuel efficient to noisy and gas guzzling fantastic You re pushed back into your seat  the smile edging across your face  Push the gas a little more through 7500 rpm  you can t hold back the giggle the world is starting to whiz by considerably faster hit the redline  you re doing 59mph  it s time for 3rd gear  good for up to 89mph Word to the wise if you re driving around the hills  you re going to be spending all your time in 2nd and 3rd  that s where all the power is for the speed range you ll be using Another note  don t expect great acceleration going up long hills  The car s torque is low enough such that it s affected by things like the grade of the road  Anyway  back to it Great  we re doing about 80mph  here comes a corner that s posted as being 25mph  You hit the brakes downshift to second  leaving you at 6000rpm  you keep braking your eye tells you 40mph should be just fine for this corner  The steering is absolutely dead on as you cross the apex  still at 5 6Krpm  you hit the gas again as you straighten out  you hit the redline  bang into 3rd  and by the time you look down  you re at 65 70mph again the corner just a fading memory The shifting  by the way  is an absolute pleasure  When you get it right  you ll find yourself thinking about it when you re not even driving the car  Repeat this process for 3 hours  Make sure you allow time to visit the hospital to see if they can remove the smile from your face Quick note  unless you ve been driving new Ferrari s recently  you ll find the S2k will have more grip than you when it comes to cornering  It took many  many trips for me to realize just how quickly the car can corner  as long as the road is  smooth and dry   Both of these factors are critical  I ve taken corners where I could ve gone 10 15mph faster  but when I ve hit a bump or a rut  the car drifted a foot or two  Had I been going faster  it may have been less pleasant  In short  KNOW the roads you re driving  or allow for it by not driving at the car s limits And lastly  to best enjoy the handling of the car go by yourself  The car handles quite differently with a passenger  even if he she only weighs 170lbs  Keep the trunk load to a minimum  too In writing this article  I was hoping to capture the greatest strengths of this car  its handling and its power  It s not a street racer  To achieve the 5 2 5 5 0 60 times posted in the mags  you need to dump your clutch at 5500rpm  That s not what this car is for  Try to ignore all the articles saying you should buy a big  heavy v8 to get a better experience  That s for a different type of driving  
 We purchased our 1998 Ford Contour Sport GL with a 16 valve  4 cylinder engine in October of 1999  What attracted us to this vehicle  It was nearly new  it was in our price range and it was a pretty blue color  In addition  all of the literature that we read about the 1998 Contour was very positive  Performance  handling  and fuel economy were highlights of reviews  From what we read in the  Lemon Aid  book  the car represented excellent value for money  However  having lived with the car for the past 12 months  I m not so sure that all of the press that the 1998 Contour received was entirely accurate  I think this car would have rated as above average within its class  but my problem with this vehicle is a lack of confidence in its quality and safety  I will address all of the realities of the Contour  both good and bad  including the numerous recalls  and hopefully you will be able to better make your decision I would like to begin with commenting on all of the great things about the 1998 Ford Contour  First  this thing handles corners like nobody s business  It hugs those bends and turns  and what that translates to is a solid  secure feeling through the car and steering wheel  Who doesn t like to feel confident of the way their car handles  This vehicle is definitely above average in this regard  and this feature is possibly my number one favorite in the 1998 Contour Next good thing about the 1998 Ford Contour is its acceleration abilities  It does really well getting up to speed in good time  Whether merging on the highway or zipping in and out of traffic in town  this car can meet your requirements  I feel that this is important to note  as several people will shy away from a 4 cylinder as it feels like you re driving a turtle  I m sure the 6 cylinder just flies by comparison  but the 4 cylinder is far from disappointing in this regard  Lastly  our Contour is absolutely great on gas  We get excellent mileage  I m certain this is due largely to the fact that this is a 4 cylinder vehicle  and given the prices of fuel these days  this is definitely a  BIG  plus  Now  I have seen reviews that differ on this point  but they do not say if they are the 4 cylinder vehicle or the 6 cylinder  We had some diagnostics done earlier this year  and the results determined that we get about 13 5 kilometers to 1 liter of gas  Things could be very different for the 6 cylinder Contour  but if you are looking for an economical vehicle to operate  consider this vehicle an option  Now  onto other matters  Yes  the Ford Contour definitely has a dark side  Since we have owned the car  there have been 2 recalls  One to adjust the wiring for the airbags to ensure that they actually do go off when needed  and one to readjust something with the rear brakes so that they would not seize in an emergency  I know of one other recall to do with the headlights  but we asked our dealer and apparently that problem was resolved with our vehicle with the previous owner  So  well  there have been at least three recalls  Let s face it recalls are a little inconvenient  but stuff gets fixed for free  so who cares  right  Well  let me ask you this does the number of recalls reflect the quality of the vehicle overall  I think it does  As a result  I m not entirely confident of the quality of the vehicle  What else is looming in the future  Will be get the next recall notice  or will we be in an accident that leads to the next recall Which leads me to my big issue with the Ford Contour  and with Ford itself  Last Saturday morning as we were zipping along the highway  my husband and I immediately noticed a very strong burning smell  My husband is a diesel mechanic  and he said it smelled like burning wiring  All of a sudden   light gray smoke  starts pouring from the glove compartment and dashboard  My husband pulls over immediately  and we haul the kids out of the car in record time  My husband then opens the passenger door  pulls down the dash panel  and rips out the offending article  A plastic three way switch and the plugs that had been in it were totally fried  resulting in the wiring burning and the plastic socket burnt and melted  Fortunately  the car is determined still operable  and we are able to drive it to our dealership When my husband relates the tale to the woman at Ford  she is very understanding and sympathetic  She even goes so far as to tell us that she knows the exact problem they ve seen   quite a few b  She tells us that the problem will be fixed free of charge  We ask her   If this is such a common problem  then why hasn t there been a recall on the car  She then told us that usually something else goes before the problem gets as serious as this  so when the customer complains of the other problem  they fix the entire thing gratis  Ford has not determined the need for a recall as of yet  She must have noticed the stunned look on our faces  because she quickly said  But no one should have went through something like this  Hmmm you know  I think she s right   No one  should have to go through this experience  but people have  Quite a few people  apparently  So why hasn t Ford issued a recall to prevent another  possibly more serious incident from happening  Maybe this is like the Freestone Tire issue there has to be a certain death toll to make results happen  In conclusion  we had previously considered the 1998 Ford Contour a really good car  We liked it  We truly did  To me  it was a good car that handled well  had a peppy four cylinder engine  and was an economical drive  But now we have to ask ourselves b Do we have confidence in this car s quality and safety standards b  The answer is a resounding   No b  Frankly  I have also lost a lot of respect and confidence in The Ford Motor Company as well  I can t recommend this vehicle to others in all conscience  despite our previous level of content with this car  as their are just too many uncertanties and questions surrounding the safety and quality of this vehicle     
 I bought the 95 Ford Windstar due to our 2 year old daughter and our future children  My husband and I previously owned a Dodge Caravan we loved  We found the Windstar for a great price  8000  with 89 000 miles Lots of miles but looked in good condition  The van was great for the first 2 months then it got crazy  First trouble with the air which turned out to be the computer  500  Then it started overheating  We checked the thermostat no problem  On the way back from the beach we blew the head gaskets  1200  And now the transmission is acting iffy  And at this point we have so much money invested in the car we can t sell so we are stuck driving it until it dies  We had read Consumer Reports before we bought the van and it checked out  Unfortunately we didn t wait long enough because now it s coming out that it s a lemon  So buyer beware br br  
 I bought my Ford Explorer in 1993 when they weren t the  quot station wagon quot  of the 90 s  I have a dirt road 1 3 mile long with lots of ruts and bumps  I haul pot bellied pigs and my dog  straw  heavy food bags and drive on the lawn  My Explorer has lasted with general maintenance and new tires  This vehicle is great for riding tough  I change the oil regularly and the air filter maybe once a year  This vehicle is not made just for good looks  This vehicle is for someone who wants to run their car  haul  and off road br br  
 I recommend this vehicle for it s safety as well as it s comfort  My husband and I liked it so much after we traded it the first time we went back to Ford and got the same truck back  The only downfall on this truck is that if you have more than one child who is ultimately going to grow up quicker than you can imagine then you will need to get the king cab  I have two children and as they grow older it is getting a bit crowded in the truck  Other than that it is a wonderful truck  It stands up much better than the other models as far as breakdowns and best built  A few months ago I backed into a dodge  which my husband wasn t very thrilled with  but the Ford never even got a scratch on it  The dodge on the other hand was so weakly built that it just dented immediately  Even my insurance agent was shocked  Not a scrap on it  So if you re looking for reliable and durable the Ford F150 XL is the way to go br br  
 What a car  I can honestly say I have never liked a car as much as I do my New Beetle  I find myself out washing it at 6 in the morning on my days off  And people always smile when they see it and I get tons of looks driving down the street  But enough about what it looks like  you say  how does it drive  Well  I have only put 2600 miles on it  I have had it for 7 weeks  but I can honestly say it drives very well  It responds quickly when I change lanes and I don t have to turn the wheel very much to do so  The brakes are excellent and respond well in rainy weather  It does bounce a little over really bumpy roads but much less than most small cars  And with the front  passenger  and side impact airbags  this car will protect you in an accident From the heated rear windows and heated front seats to the sunroof and leather interior  this car has a lot of luxury to it  There are 2 power outlets  one can be made into a cigarette lighter if you are a smoker  and lots of other cute little things that are also very functional  I also think it is very roomy and that is what surprised me the most  I am no Kate Moss and I find the front seat very spacious  My 6 4 quot  cousin had no trouble riding in the front seat  he was about an inch too tall for the back  The car is not perfect though  The cupholders are pretty useless and it doesn t come with a compass  something I have noticed in other German car giants like BMW  All things considered  I will happily take these two  quot problems quot  for the wonderful car I get in return If you have a big family  this is not the car for you  If you are looking for a fun  reliable  luxury car  without the luxury price  then consider a New Beetle  You will never want to drive another car again br br  
 Prior to this car  I had a A4 for over 3 years  so I am very familiar with the basic platform  I was extremely pleased with the A4  and felt that the only things that were seriously wrong with it could be fixed by adding some power and tightening up the suspension The S4 addresses these concerns and more  It is truly an awesome car  You can thrash 97 percent of the other cars on the road in this thing  yet  you can still troll around town in perfect comfort or cruise the highway in ease and serenity Power and torque are outstanding  With 250 HP on tap  this thing leaps off the line and pulls really hard in every gear  Zero to sixty times in magazine tests are listed at around 5 5 seconds  I have no data to testify to exact numbers  but my seat of the pants experience would back it up  Suffice it so say that there are only a few cars on the road today that will be able to keep up with you if you really put the whip to the horses   and most of those cost a lot more than the S4 And  you can not forget the advantages of Audi s Quattro awd system  When people think about awd  they usually think about enhanced traction in mud or snow  However  Audi s first application of quattro was in race cars as a high performance handling enhancement  Audi led the way with quattro in rally cars  now all WRC cars are awd  and dominated touring car racing to the point where the sanctioning body dis allowed all wheel drive because it was too much of a competitive advantage  To get a sense of what an S4 can do when it is not outlawed  check out the SCCA Speed World Challenge  where the Champion Audi S4 has dominated a field of Porsches  BMWs  Corvettes and Acuras  To make a long story short  quattro is as much a benefit for high performance driving as it is for bad weather driving  Cornering grip  acceleration out of corners  and many other areas of driving are enhanced by Audi s excellent  reliable quattro system S4 vs  A4  The Audi A4 S4 exterior is handsome and doesn t really draw too much attention to you  Most people will asssume you re just another nice sedan on the road  Car enthusiasts  however  will recognize the subtle changes that differentiate the S4 from the A4 and will appreciate them  The larger wheels and tires  the lower stance  etc Other differences include the bi turbo engine  the quicker steering rack  upgraded brakes  the sports seats  the 6 speed manual transmission  All these transform the S model from a competent sedan into a real screamer The upgraded steering is wonderful  The car changes direction with far more accuracy and immediacy than the A4  I believe the S4 also benefits from grippier tires and a significantly stiffer suspension  All in all  this is a car that handles superbly  However  this is also the one area in which I feel the car could still benefit from improvement  Compared to cars like the BMW M3  or a Porsche Boxster  the Audi S4 still exhibits too much body roll in the corners  and too much squat and dive when accelerating and braking  Compared with most other cars on the road  the S4 is way ahead  but  a car this good invites comparison with other superlative cars   and in this area the S4 is definitely a little bit behind  My other minor complaint is the shift linkage  Here again  the Audi 6 speed manual shifter clutch is fine  but  it is not as smooth or precise as those offered by BMW and Porsche In most other areas  I feel that the Audi S4 is the best high performance sedan available today Audi has redesigned the A4 platform for 2002 and to my eye they have take a step in the wrong direction  I believe the S4  which is based on the old 2001 A4  not the redesigned 2002 model  is far more handsome  I tested both the new 3 liter A4 model with the sport suspension and 6 speed tranny and the  old  S4 before I made my decision  The new A4 does offer some improvements over the older A4 model  But  it still leaves a great deal to be desired when compared to the S model  The S is still quicker  sharper  and more luxurious  Harder to describe is a more subtle feeling  the S4 feels like it was hand built by a fine german tuning shop  The new A4 feels like it was welded by robots on an assembly line  That said  I look forward with great anticipation to the new S4 that will arrive in a couple of years based on the new A4 platform The S4 is truly a super car  
 Finally  a S U V  that was in my price range without sacrificing quality  I am 6 4 and I fit in the truck very comfortably  and the ride is still smooth for a compact  I ve already logged a few thousand miles and for the most part I ve been very happy with my choice  The Escape is not perfect  for example  the shift selector on the steering column hinders access to the controls on the radio  a slight aggravation at times  I guess that s one of the drawbacks in getting the first model year of a vehicle  all the kinks are not worked out yet  I was not looking to buy when I stopped by the lot to pass some extra time that I had  but when I seen and eventually test drove the truck I was SOLD  It handles nice around corners  and the acceleration packs some punch  Also  with all this bad weather we ve had lately going through the snow with the four wheel drive on makes the drive not only manageable but fun br br  
 I own a 1996 F150 extended cab and although I like the truck it does have some problems  Some of the problems are that it does not have that much power and it is not the most comfortable ride  Mine also has poor electrical system because when you shut the drivers door the light doesn t always go off and I have had to get it fixed twice  The good things about this is that it does get good gas mileage and it gives you a good view for the road  The other thing is that is also a dependable truck  Mine has almost 160 000 miles on it and other than the electrical the only I had to get fixed was the gas pump but that was still under warranty  
 I never thought in a million years that I would be driving a mini van  I m only 25 years old  why would I want to be driving something that my mom drove me around in  Well  just last year my wife had a baby  We needed a car that would be safe  reliable  and still have plenty of room for the baby s things  I don t know how it happened  but we ended up at the Chrysler dealer  My wife loved the way the Town and Country looked and drove  We were sold  I had to drive it home myself  I was amazed on how it handled  I didn t want to stop driving  It was more than I have ever wanted in a vehicle  Even though it is a mini van  it has plenty of power and a great stereo  This is the mini van for both young and old     
 Ford s new Focus is a car that doesn t try to be all things to all people  It s got lines that you either love or hate  and style that is unique  if not truly ground breaking  In my case  I liked the styling of the ZX3 model enough to take one for a spin  The four door model initially seemed attractive  but I find Ford s  quot New Edge quot  styling doesn t take as well on that model as it does on the two door  A year after its introduction  the four door s styling seems a little tired already Initial impressions The Focus I tested was painted in a very pleasant gold colour  with a charcoal interior  The paint was well applied and very lustrous Exterior fit and finish was excellent Inside  the fit and finish was equally good  The styling  however  couldn t completely compensate for a somewhat sombre tone that permeated the entire cabin The overall look and feel of the car  with its relatively high roofline  was vaguely reminiscent of the new Toyota Echo  While you could never confuse an Echo with a Focus  you could be forgiven for wondering  in a classic  chicken or egg  fashion which came first Driving impressions The Focus is very easy to get in and out of The one thing that struck me immediately about the car and left an indelible impression  I think was how comfortable the driving position was The driver s seat was comfortable without being sloppy  and supportive without feeling like a church pew  What was really impressive was the seat s height adjustment  which lets you tailor your driving position to your taste in an almost infinite number of ways  I can well imagine lowering the seat for long  lazy highway drives  while raising it for in town vehicular combat  where a commanding position is crucial The telescoping steering wheel is also a unique feature  It adds  in a synergistic way to the driver s ability to select a driving position that works for  rather than against him  In this era of  de contented  cars  that s a very compelling reason to buy Ergonomics were generally good  with everything close to hand and easy to find In town  the car handled well  Steering was precise  and offered good feedback  The substantial tires that came with the car likely play a significant role in how it feels on the road One minor drawback of the Focus is that its roofline tapers quickly towards the back reducing rearward vision and demanding that care be taken when checking blind spots Braking was decent  and better than all of the cars I ve tried so far  save for the Mazda Protege Ride was very good for a small car   in fact  it s probably the best of all the new cars I ve tested so far   quot Smooth and supple quot  are words that come to mind when trying to describe the ride quality With the exception of noise that is produced when the engine is pushed  the car is very quiet  The quietude speaks volumes  really  because it shows Ford engineers did their homework in the NVH  Noise  Vibration and Harshness  department  Sometimes perception is everything  and in this area  less is truly more Management of NVH  among other things is what separates great small cars from the merely mediocre  Get those three issues right and you ve got a car that can easily compete with the likes of Mercedes and BMW The Focus ZX3 I drove came with a manual 5 speed transmission  Shifting was a little vague and rubbery  but not sticky  Generally  the transmission didn t seem to make very good use of the power transmitted by the Zetec 2 0 litre engine  As a result  low end torque was lacking  forcing drivers to tromp on the gas more than necessary A brief blast down the highway showed me where the Focus really shines  In third gear torque is abundant  and cruising speed is reached quickly  Amazingly  for a small car  it felt rock solid at speeds above 80km h  55MPH  with none of the skittishness or jumpiness that plagues so many sub compacts  I ve been looking for a small car that also doubles as a good highway hauler and I think I ve found it in the Focus The Bottom Line The Ford Focus is a very good car  People who find the latest offerings from Honda and Toyota a bit lacking would do well to look at a Focus  It s certainly the equal of a Toyota Corolla or a Honda Civic and in many respects superior  It s miles ahead less esteemed sub compacts The ZX3 is probably best suited to single people carrying themselves and one passenger  Family types would probably do better with the four door or the wagon which is probably just as good looking as the ZX3 Two things dissuaded me from buying a Focus  Namely  the lack of low end torque  and price  In Canada  a base Focus ZX3  with the tilt steering seat adjustment package 700  and an essential item  as far as I m concerned goes for about  17000 00  Add 15  for federal and provincial sales taxes  and all the other fees involved in buying a car  and you re up to twenty bills in no time When I think of small cars  I think of the word  economy  The Focus may be well built but economical it ain t A Focus may yet see its way into my driveway  I just have to find a way to come up with the extra coin needed to show it the way home Overall Rating  B     
 Since many of the reviews here are very well done and give excellent detail of the car I decided to do a direct comparison approach to another excellent vehicle  The BMW 330ci  I know it 146s not a 2 seater  but is a coupe  but the 330ci is an excellent car to use as the mark for excellence for anything  performance oriented  built by anyone under the 40k price  I hope my review will not make you decide what to purchase but rather help you decide based on a comparison basis to a world class car brand  BMW Mike I just spent some time behind the wheel of this VERY FUN vehicle and have a review I would like to share  I currently lease a BMW E46  323ci  and a close friend owns a E46  330ci  so my review will be heavily compared to the BMW 3 series  I have also spent a great deal behind the wheel of a new Mustang GT but still do not like the handling of the nose heavy and straight rear axel of the fast pony but it should still be considered for people that love going fast in a straight line  Of course the 2005 Mustang with new chassis  independent rear axel and new engine should be a major improvement from Ford  I would also say if you can wait another year the new Mustang may be the new king of the streets for its price range Now 133 My opinion  The new 350Z is one nice looking car and will make you get many looks as you pass people  As for handling it will beat anything under the 30k price range  I would not even think of comparing a true rear wheel sports car to ANY front wheel drive car at ANY price 133   on dry pavement  All front wheel cars suffer from poor balancing and can 146t ever compete 133 at least not yet  As for its engine performance the car is very fast and probably can only be beaten by a Mustang GT in the under 30k price tag  But take a few turns and the Mustang will only see your tail lights  As for Ergonomics 133  this is where the 350Z really disappoints me  This is also why I will tell you guys why you should also HEAVILY consider a new BMW E46 since the 325ci is about the same price and the 330ci is about 3k more then the top model 350Z  with premium sound and sports package on the BMW  Anyway  the 350Z has doors so high you will not be relaxing on a nice summer day with the arm out the window and give you a very claustrophobic feeling  The rear view is SO HORRIBLE that you will not see the windshield of the car behind you if he is more then 50ft away 133  It will take getting use to  The center console has no arm rest for those that shift in heavy traffic and this will cause fatigue  I have decided to stick with BMW and will tell you all that YOU SHOULD DRIVE a 330ci BEFORE buying a 350Z  The 330ci is nearly as fast even though it hast about 50 less HP and will handle as well as the 350Z on any track or any road in my opinion  and a MUCH better ride to boot  PLUS the BMW will be FAR more comfortable  has a FAR better interior  the HK sound system blows away the Bose  has WAY more cargo space  a back seat  less blind behind you  feels better balanced  has better steering  350Z is too light  the breaks on the 330ci are huge and work well  although the Brembo 146s on the 350Z are nice  Many more things can be considered but you should find out by yourself by driving the BMW and the 350Z  I know other will say you can buy the 350Z for much less with the lesser models and save considerably over the BMW but the BMW comes standard with features that will only come in the better 350Z models 133 such as stability control and huge breaks  Plus BMW 146s are much more configurable as far as options go 133 you only pay for what you need  Typical of Japanese companies you MUST have some features to get others and I always hated this 133  Packages suck  note  If you need is a weekend fun car that will punish many cars on the road today with a combination of speed and handling the 350Z wins hands down with pure FUN factor  Since it does feel  147sportier 148 then the BMW  But if you desire to take long trips  carry luggage  take extra passengers and like having the prestige of owning the BMW name then drive one and see for yourself how awesome the  147Ultimate Driving Machine 148 really is 133  Also I did not forget Corvette 133 133 it 146s a 350Z with more  147balls 148 133  if you want to pay 8 10k more  I can 146t recommend the BMW M3 due to its nearly 50k price 133  Also the BMW I6 and the Nissan V6 are both considered the best 6cyl engines in the world and both are extremely reliable 133  With the BMW feeling smoother through the RPM range but not by much 133 133  Enjoy your test drives and if the 350Z 146s shortcoming don 146t bother you its one AWSOME deal for the price  based on pure performance ability  Hands down  If you think your front wheel drive car handles well then you have never driven a real rear wheel drive independent suspension sports car and will be blown away by how much better it will feel compared to the front heavy front drive cars most kids tend to like these days ALSO  DO NOT get the model lesser then the Performance model if you plan to drive in rain or snow  YOU WANT stability control  for safety  I feel very strongly about this after having this feature for the last 3 years  for dry performance you may want to turn it off if you are a skilled driver OK  one more thing  Nissan should put adjustable struts in this car in future models  or get a nice set of after markets I think I am done now   A note about the dealership I went to  Atlantic Auto Mall on Long Island  Loved my experience with them  Much better then the arrogance you will get from most BMW dealers  BMW s are not easy to buy below sticker price and this may turn off some people  
 In September 2000  I bought my first new car  a 2001 Hyundai Accent GL Hatchback with a manual transmission for about  9000  Since then  I have been more than satisfied with this little car  Because I spent less than  10 000 for a spanking new car  I didn t have the high expectations I would have if I had chosen a more expensive vehicle  I wanted a dependable ride that would last me at least five years with no maintenance problems  and at 51 000 miles  my Accent has never left me stranded and is still running great What I like about the Accent Not only does this little car get great mileage  I average around 33 mpg  but I can park it almost anywhere  For urban drivers  this is a major plus  I can easily zip in and out of traffic and claim parking spaces in which most cars wouldn t be able to fit  I like the sporty profile  and the moderately roomy trunk  With the 60 40 split backseat  I can fit even longer cargo comfortably in the trunk  I ve used this car to move the contents of my apartment across town  and I was amazed at how much I could actually fit in there  I do a lot of driving  weekend trips back and forth from D C  to Philly  and I ve never been concerned about being stranded on the highway  The warranty is great and it even comes with roadside assistance for five years  I like the sporty profile  and if the Hyundai logo wasn t visible  I would think it was a more expensive car  Volkswagen  Saab  maybe  People that see my car for the first time often say how cute it is  I m too practical to have the pride thing when it comes to my vehicle  although I do wish the Hyundai name wasn t synonymous with  cheap  What can I say  I m practical and frugal What I don t like about the Accent I like to drive pretty fast  er  officer  I mean  I always drive the speed limit  and the Accent really doesn t like moving faster than about 80 mph  I m sure I could push it  but it s obvious that this car prefers to drive the speed limit  I m probably better off  anyway  The pick up is pretty weak  even with the best shifting of gears  but once it gets going  the power is decent  In other words  don t pull out into quickly moving traffic unless you ve got some room to accelerate  The interior is rather small  and while I m certainly not cramped while driving  my backseat passengers are  It s not very often that I have a full load  but when I do  the Accent s suspension is working overtime  Avoid potholes  or suffer the painful thud when it bottoms out  I was a coffee drinker and cigarette smoker when I first bought my car  and one of the first design flaws I noticed was that when the cup holder is in the out position  the ashtray is inaccessible  Also  on rainy days when I d crack open my window to smoke  a fairly steady stream of water would drip on my left arm  It seemed to me that the Hyundai designers were obviously not smokers  I ve since quit smoking  but these were big inconveniences for me while I still did  There were other annoying  relatively minor problems  too  My low gas warning light works intermittently  at best  It sometimes comes on briefly as I reach a near empty level  but it doesn t stay on  One of the plastic pegs holding the hatch cover in place broke off after 2 years  and has been a pain to have replaced  It s such a small part that every time the service department at the Hyundai dealership orders a replacement  they lose it right away  I could probably just glue it back on  but it s the principle  The bumper to bumper warranty covers this repair  and I shouldn t have to fix it myself  Lastly  the front passenger seatbelt tends to  trap  my passengers  It slowly constricts such that after just a few minutes  my passenger needs to take it off and put it back on  This doesn t happen on the driver side  so it s not too much of an inconvenience for me  but I wouldn t pick up a date for fear that they d think I was trying to trap them in my car  I ve had the belt replaced  but the new one does the same thing  Overall  the Accent is a reliable  economical vehicle that I plan to keep for several more years  Aside from a few annoying flaws and a weak engine  the car hasn t given me anything to complain about  With the Accent  you get what you pay for  
 The Ford Ranger is obviously the veteran of the compact truck market and is obviously the most  quot bang for your buck quot  Great off road package for everyone that loves to turn their boring street truck into a  quot Ranger for Danger quot  off road project  Great gas mileage  very nice horsepower from 146   3 000 rpms to 180   3 750 rpms  it is a great truck  Ford has always been the best in the compact truck market compared to Dodge and Chevy  The only thing i see wrong with the Ford Ranger is the manual style mirrors now my opinions on those are that i rather have electric styled mirrors for obvious reasons but your opinion might be different  But overall this truck is a perfect truck for ANYONE so if u have some money to burn check this truck out br br  
 I bought a new 97 F150  and I had it only 4 months and traded it in It was a v8  and it had no power what so ever We live on a mountain  and I would have to shift into 3rd gear to climb it  while little 4cy s were flying up it  I was embarrassed Sorry  but when I put that much money into something  I want it to perform for me  and this truck didn t I think this truck is best suited for flat areas  it did do well at highway speeds  but like I said   no power pulling a hill To be honest I like a truck that is a little more flashy looking  and this didn t make me say  quot wow quot this was the only vehicle that we have owned that I could say I hated it I know some people are reading this and saying they love their truck and I am glad you like yours  I didn t like mine br br  
  Overview b  First off  I d like to say that I REALLY like this car  and I m very picky about cars maybe even LOVE  It s pretty fast  luxurious  looks great  and since it s built by Toyota  you know it s reliable  I ve been driving the car for well over a month  I got one of the first ones at my dealership  so I think I can give a decent review  It s a long review so have a seat and put the kids to sleep b FYI b  This car is know as the Toyota Aristo  JZS161  in Japan  The only real differences being is no GS430 in Japan  The closest is the V300 Vertex Edition which is a 280 HP turbo charged inline 6  The GS300 is close to the Japanese version  of course  their cars are right hand drive b EXTERIOR BODY   RATING  9  This year  Lexus did some VERY minor updates  The front grill has wider bars and less of them and a bigger Lexus logo  The back tail lights also have been updated  More red with a lens in lens look  I think the grill and the lights looks better than the previous GS s  Other than that  it looks the same as the previous GS  Fit is great  Paint job is mediocre  but it s as good as any factory paint job if you want a awesome looking paint job  have your car  color sanded   by a professional body shop it s not a weekend job for Joe Average  to take out all the  orange peel  and it ll look like a million bucks guaranteed  color sanding will make it a 10 The water repelling driver passenger side widows is very cool if you live a rainy area  in Southern Cali  this isn t a big feature b WHEELS   RATING  4  I just got the stock 16  non chrome wheels  Why  Well for one  I hate chrome  it s ghetto nowadays  and the factory 17  are looking dated it s the same wheel since 1998  Also  there was no point in paying extra for the wheel upgrade when I already have 20  rims on order  WHATEVER you do  do NOT pay  1900  or whatever  for the  17  Chrome Wheel  package  If you REALLY want the factory 17  chrome wheels  just get the  200 upgrade  from 16  to 17  and then take your wheels to a chroming place and pay less than  400 to get all four chromed  make sure they triple chrome with a nickel base DO NOT get the  one step  chrome they ll chip or wear within a few months  You ll save yourself  1300 which you can send to me in small  unmarked bills  At any rate  whoever runs the wheel department at Lexus needs to be FIRED for offering such lame rim choices and for charging WAY too much money  for the chrome  The Lexus 17  chrome wheels are just a straight out RIP OFF Some Lexus dealerships offer  aftermarket  wheels  DO NOT BUY FROM THEM  These are low quality  cheap brand rims that they try to pawn off for TONS of money  Visit websites like www wheelexperts com and buy some HIGH QUALITY Japanese rims  You can also get some HIGH QUALITY FORGED  the best method  American wheels from www hrewheels com  www fikse com or www kinesismotorsports com  Remember  this is a LUXURY CAR  Spending anything less than a few thousand dollars on EXCELLENT rims is stupid  If you re going to  cheap out  on the wheels  don t even bother  Just leave the stock wheels otherwise  you re just going to cheapen your GS430  and look ghetto in the process Stay away from brands like Giovanna  G Racing  Lexani  Alba  Arelli  etc  These are LOW quality wheel that are not only UGLY AS SIN  but they cost a TON of money because like P T  Barnum said   There 146s a Sucker Born Every Minute  These are popular among  rappers  such because they don t know sh t about wheels  they just want whatever is shiny and obnoxious  it s called  Bling Bling stupid Brands you should consider include  HRE  Fikse  Kinesis Motorsports  LowenHart  Racing Hart  Rays Volk  Lsportline  Dazz  Weds  Manaray Sports  AVS Advan  Yokohama  BIM Creative  Bridgestone  etc  etc Excellent quality 1 piece rims should cost around  350 wheel and up  Excellent quality 3 piece rims should cost around  600 wheel and up  Don t spend any less otherwise  just sell your Lexus and buy a Honda Civic Lexus also offers some rims under their  L Tuned  program  sort of a  Sport  package like BMW or Mercedes except on the Lexus  it s all reliable also  did you know the American BMW M3 is a FAKE check the web we don t get the  real  M3  They have some different rims  18  and 17  but these wheels are not that exciting  All the L Tuned is just mediocre compared to what you can get in the aftermarket  The ONLY thing I do recommend is the L Tuned Steering ECU  Now I have heard that the newer built GS430 s already have this ECU built in so you may not need it  You can check with your local dealer or L Tuned to find out  I had one installed on mine and it made a difference  I also have one of the earliest GS430 s b INTERIOR   RATING  9 9  I opted for the Black interior and it looks fantastic  The leather quality is excellent  Fit is perfect  Wood trim looks good and is finished perfectly and it s REAL  Infiniti and Acura  please take note  The carpets are nice and thick  Seat adjustments are great  The controls are excellent in feel  when will American car companies figure out their interiors look like CRAP I also opted for the wood steering wheel and I LOVE it  The audio controls on the steering wheel are excellent  the audio controls also come on the non wood steering wheel  You can change inputs  CD  Radio  Tape  etc  change CDs Tracks  stations  volume up down  and there s a  set  button that lets you have a  preset  volume  I have mine set to real low so I can use it as  mute  button  for cell phone calls or police Other parts of the interior center console is a double level deal with a extra accessory jack in the bottom compartment to charge your cell phone  laptop  etc  The glove box contains the CD changer  6 disc  and a extra compartment to the right of the CD changer for a extra magazine  a paperback book  etc    The main compartment of the glove box looks huge but it s really not  It s really tight when you close it  When closed  anything that s close to the front of the glove box must be shorter in thickness than the user manual  about 1  or it ll get crushed  I guess it can be described as a wedge shaped glove box when closed I almost crushed a good pair sunglasses The drink holders are by the shifter and they only hold regular size drinks no 7 11 Super Big Gulps TM  here The drink holder in front  closest to the radio  seems to hold larger drinks but not by much The rear seats are comfy with a nice wide center console with drink holders  only for regular size drinks again  but I don t really care about the back seats    I still don t understand why Lexus can t get GOOD drink holders Fat Lazy Americans like to have big friggin  drinks in their car  I m sure in Japan  those cute Red Bull size cans are all the rage  along with the cute Red Bull size cars  but not here Anyways the gauges look awesome  as then have since 1998 version  the HomeLink system is great  as most cars have this now  seat memory is also good  remembers the side mirror locations too  How about a memory rear view mirror too  And how about a reverse assisting passenger side mirror like in the LS430  hey  when you have  5000 rims  you ll understand  It s about  5 worth of electronics for that feature and Lexus can t add that in b DRIVE HANDLING   STOCK RATING  6  NOW  9 b Let me explain this rating the car drive AWESOME if you want a nice quite luxurious ride  That s all great and dandy for my mother  but for me  I like a little more AS5 whooping in the ride  my Mom likes the way Cadillacs ride drive so what does that tell you  I want race car like handling with a luxury ride I know that everyone buys into BMW s marketing and how BMW s are suppose to handle like DTM Touring cars  YEAH  RIGHT  but in reality  they don t  Stock for stock  a 540 does handle better than a GS430  but with a few small add ons  the tables turn BIG TIME After have a few items installed  the handling rating is now a solid 9  not 10 read on  I have since installed full coilovers  Tein CS  lowered 2 5  upgraded TRD Sway Bars  thicker  TRD Strut Tower Bar for the front  TRD Chassis Brace  L Tuned Steering ECU  and of course  20  wheels  20 which are NOT ideal for handling 19  or even 18  would be better but I m willing to sacrifice a LITTLE handling for the look of 20 s on my car which is why I said it will be a rating of 9  not 10  Even with 20 s  I still burn those fakers  check out www beaterz com  you see what I mean  down my local canyon Even with all this added on  my GS430 still cost less than a comparable BMW 540 and now not only is it faster than the 540  even the 540 Manual  it outhandles it with no problem  My tail lights are a familiar sight to every BMW owner trying to race me down my local canyons b ACCELERATION   RATING  8  Why not a 10  Because when you own a Honda RC51  no car that you can buy for any reasonable amount of money  will satisfy you  Not to mention that I ve be in sub 11 second quarter mile Honda 4 bangers  a built twin turbo Supra  a 450HP supercharged LS400  a built R34 Nissan Skyline GTR  I would take this over a Ferrari anyday  etc for a 4 3 liter motor  it should have more than 300HP  350 375HP would have been good for me  Compared to most other cars though  it s pretty quick  5 8sec  0 60 AUTOMATIC isn t shabby for a heavy 4 door luxury sedan I heard that Lexus is planning on bumping up the horsepower rating soon I plan on doing my own horsepower increase via a SuperCharger   b OVERALL   RATING  9   Yeah  yeah  yeah 9 is not the average of the scores I gave so what  The 9 rating is because the car is an excellent overall car and can be fixed up to be a SERIOUSLY B A D A S S car  There is a LOT of stuff for this car  both here and overseas  in the aftermarket arena  This is a good thing if you re into fixing up your car One thing that REALLY P I S S E S me off is that the GS430 is no longer offered with E SHIFT  Some BS about how Lexus wanted to meet ULEV rating or something whatever the reason was  the GS430 SHOULD have E Shift  Whoever made that decision at Lexus should also be hunted down and tortured seriously  that was a REALL DUMB AS5 decision b Oh yeah the obligatory Q A  1  Why did I buy this vehicle    Because I have always loved the design of this car and it has the potential to be bad a s s  And even stock  it s a excellent ride 2  Describe what you love and hate about this vehicle    Read above monologue 3  What is it like to drive this vehicle    Refer to question 2 4  Who should buy this vehicle    Whoever can afford it with one catch If you plan on fixing this car up and you can bearly afford the car payments  get something else instead  It s better to fix up a car you can afford the RIGHT way rather than fixing up a car you can BEARLY afford the WRONG way  The WRONG way is buying cheap add ons  Fake add ons  Knock off rims  etc  Don t do that  Don t turn your luxury ride into a a ghetto P O S  DO IT RIGHT OR DON T DO IT AT ALL mp5pdw ps  From all the years of doing crack  I forgot to include the Nav and Mark Levinson review  and I just remembered that you can edit your reviews so check out the first post in the Comments section where I added those little tidbits in  
 I fell in love with the cadillac deville a few years ago  My daughter was looking for a new luxury car and by chance we stopped at a cadillac dealer  He invited me to sit in a deville and i just fell instantly in love  I knew this was my dream car  The seats felt like you were sitting on a cloud  The interior of the car makes you feel as though you are wrapped in a warm safe blanket  A few weeks ago I was treated to a ride in a Deville and I came to the conclusion that I will own one of these cars in the near future  I love the way your speed is illuminated in big numbers so that you don t have to guess at your speed  The heated seats are wonderful so that you can be comfortable and not interfere with anyone eles s comfort  This is the car of my dreams br br  
 I still love my kitty and have written two reviews previous to this one  However  I have four problems now and I am starting to be concerned My 99 Cougar 6 cyl  has 21 000 miles on it now First I am not a happy camper  The city I live in  which boasts a population of over 38 000 people has lost it s Mercury Dealer  This has left me with a drive of over 45 miles to my nearest dealer for any repairs or maintenance  I am not happy about this  nor was I given any notice from Mercury  I found out after a recent recall on the brakes  Second Shortly after this recall repair being done on my kitty  I noticed the back seat was making a noise  Rarely does anyone sit in my back seat  I looked and found a plastic clamp that holds the seat to the frame had been broken  How this happened  I do not know  Interesting though  as now you can see underneath the car from the inside  I have always wanted to do that    Now I am forced to drive 45 miles to have this looked at  a part ordered and then drive back when the part is in and wait for it to be repaired  Not happy again Third Now for the biggest concern I have  This has to do with a noise I am hearing from the front end  I think I have finally figured it out I think it has something to do with my idle  I noticed last evening when I heard this noise  my tach was idling at 2 000 rpm  A normal idle for me is a little under 1 000 rpm  I cannot describe the noise  except it sounds like something is stuck  Almost like a belt but without the squealing sound Previous to this I thought it had something to do with the brakes  I am always braking when I hear this noise  Last night  I happened to be braking at a very icy intersection and my car did not want to stop  I looked at the tach and realized why  Be careful out there  I did go a little farther then I wanted to at this intersection This usually happens in cold weather and it has been extremely cold here in the last few days  Average daytime temperatures have been 15 degrees  The first time I heard this noise was last year  again extremely cold  I did not hear it again until recently  I thought it was gone  Now it is happening more frequently and I will have to get this checked out during my next 45 mile drive ONE WAY to the dealer Fourth Always knocking when on interstate  I have done everything to correct this  The timing  the best gas  all grades  and had this repeatedly checked out  This car only knocks when at speeds of 60 mph or higher  I noticed this during the summer on frequent trips on the interstate  I do not hear it any other time and trying to convince the dealership of this is impossible  I guess they are not taking it out on the interstate  Any slight pressure on the accelerator and it starts knocking  Other than that I still like this car but I am starting to look around for something else  It hasn t been doing very well with the wide tires on the ice lately  Feeling like I might be ready for a more conservative change  It might be a good idea considering some of the problems I have been experiencing and the fact that the nearest dealer is 45 MILES ONE WAY  Oh yeah  I mentioned that didn t I If anyone else has any similar problems to mine  please let me know  Perhaps I can give some advice to the dealer to help fix these items  You know the one that is 45 miles ONE WAY smud br br  
 The Taurus I am driving is a company car assigned to me a little over 2 year ago  The following information should be useful for someone who is considering purchasing one as a used car EXTERIOR  3 My white Taurus looks like an albino sperm whale  The rounded windshield  rounded rear window  bug eyed headlights  and the smiling mouth grill opening combine to make this a cartoon of a car INTERIOR  5 The interior appears to be well thought out with one exception  the terrible ergonomics of the front seats  There is no lumbar support or side support  I ve developed chronic aches in my shoulders from leaning on the fold down center console and the inside of the driver door  I am 5 5 quot  and weigh 125 lbs  Perhaps the seats were designed for much wider drivers  Three of my colleague  of various girth  who also drive the Taurus complained the same of the GL s base seats  Other than the seats  The rest interior is very roomy and quiet at any speed  Headroom and legroom are plentiful  The dash is made of high grade plastic and rattle free even after 75 000 miles  The trunk will swallow just about anything even plywood with the rear seats folded down  The lift over height may be low  but the wide tail lamps reduced the trunk width ENGINE  8 The 3 0 liter V6 accelerates very nicely and provides excellent fuel economy for a full size car nearly 30MPG freeway HANDLING  8 Sometimes forgetting that this is not a sports car  I would take some curves too fast  The Taurus is very forgiving  however  in response with some body roll and tire squeals  Very good handling for an American sedan RELIABILITY  3 My company purchased about 20 of these vehicles and reliability has become an issue  One Taurus  definitely a lemon  was in the shop 3 times within a one year period for the same problem  The engine would just quit while cruising on the freeway  The dealership replaced several electrical components before the problem went away  At approximately 60 000 miles most of these cars began experiencing transmission  quot slips or lurches quot  We spent  1200 on one of these  Just last week  the mass air flow sensor  some component for emissions control and engine regulation  went out on mine  The part itself costs  400 VALUE  4 The depreciation on the Taurus is horrendous  from  20 000 to  5000 in four years THE VERDICT  A VERY GOOD CAR WHEN NEW WITH UPGRADED SEATS Don t purchase this as a used vehicle unless you are a mechanic or have a mechanic buddy     
 The main reason I bought the Expedition instead of the Explorer is head room and size  The Explorer does not have adequate headroom for this 6 4  dad  Plus I have a lot of stuff I need to haul around My wife and I decided to hop on the bandwagon and get a van or SUV like 75  of Suburbia USA so we could look everyone else in the eye and get more than our fair share of the remaining fuel on the planet  Well  I ve been driving a  95 Dodge Ram for 8 years  so not a big change for me  it was big and loved gas too Unfortunately  I ve noticed some people are offended by the large SUV  I don t blame them in a way  They are really big  block their view  people drive them like they own the road  and they do eat a lot of gas  I make fun of it almost as much myself  It is an elephant of a car  but I like it I found a good deal on a used  03  but it has the 4 6 liter V8  I test drove the 5 4 liter and couldn t tell a big difference in power  30 horsepower difference is all  But 5 4 was new and not broken it yet  Anyway  they need to get more power in these big things  260 horsepower may sound like a lot  but not in a 5500 pound vehicle  It needs a supercharger or something  I don t know  I think more power might improve gas mileage as well Speaking of gas mileage  I m NOT getting 14 city  It s more like 11 5 or 12 mpg  I got 16 mpg highway which is close to their estimate of 17 mpg but I drove about 75 mph Otherwise  I really enjoy driving this vehicle  To me it doesn t feel as big and heavy as it really is  I took some pretty swift turns in a parking lot and it really hangs in there with bit of over steer  the back end slides out a little  The confident feel of the vehicle is what sold me in the first place plus it s HUGE  I like that  
 1997 was the year that we leased the Expedition from Kearny Mesa Ford  and to say the least  that was the beginning of our NIGHTMARE  We got the Red Carpet Lease  whatever the heck that means  for 2 years and 15K Miles per year  We got the vehicle September 14th and we were so excited since its been a while since we got a new vehicle  much less an SUV  The next day  me and my family when to church and was on our way home and all of a sudden  the truck made this weird sound  We thought it was the air conditioning  so we turned that off  It continued to make that irritating noise  so my husband decided to pull over to the side of the freeway  That s it  The whole truck died on us  so we had to call a towing service and had it returned to the dealership  That whole incident freaked me out to say the least  After only one day of having the truck  the next day it s back in the shop  At that point  we called the dealership and told them that we no longer wanted the TRUCK  And the dealership said quot Sorry No Can DO quot  To make the long story short  we got stuck with that  598 00 per month lease but we are done with it and do you think I will recommend their dealership to anyone after they screwed us BIG TIME NO WAY And also  they should consider redesigning the front passenger seats it s way too uncomfortable br br  
 In the year 1988 I purchased one of the best American luxury sedans  That is what I thought  But I was wrong  It was a Chrysler New Yorker  Please no one should buy any kind of Chrysler cars including this one  They should stop making Chrysler because Chrysler is a car that falls apart all the time  The only good things about this car are the special functions  Some of the special functions in this car were the leather seats  automatic windows  locks and seats  automatic transmission and mirrors  lots of storage compartments  digital compass  with two storage compartments on the top etc  Here are all the problems I have had with this car 1  The mirror on the glass fell off many times 2  Changed the brakes many times 3  The stereo cassette player broke 4  When you turn on the a c  the car stops running 5  The engine will stop working after 30 000 miles 6  The battery will also stop working after 30 000 miles 7  The fan belt kept on going even though the car was stopped  This car broke down many times while I was driving  and this car also wasted a lot of my money  So don t buy a Chrysler New Yorker  It s a bad car  In fact I would suggest don t buy any kind of Chrysler cars  Other wise you will waste a lot of your money in putting repairs into Chrysler cars  Don t buy any kind of cars that the Chrysler corporation makes  They stopped making Chrysler New Yorkers in 1996  That s good  So in the summer of 1999 I sold my Chrysler New Yorker to a ford dealer and bought a much better and safer car the 1999 Ford Crown Victoria  I m glad I sold my Chrysler New Yorker  Finally after 11 long years I got rid of my big headache  I wouldn t recommend this car to no one br br  
 Here s an option for Wrangler tops you probably haven t heard or thought of if you re considering the dual top option  buy your Jeep with a soft top  then buy an after market hard top  The dual top option that is available for Wranglers is an excellent choice if you want the convenience of a soft top on those summer days when you re caught miles from home in a thunderstorm  But in the winter or during long periods of rain  you can put the hard top on and feel like you ve got some solid protection Buying a hard top from an after market company  e g  JC Whitney  ProPerformance  etc  is a better value because of the superior quality in construction  The after market hard tops are usually stronger and more durable than the thin top that comes with the Wrangler  They are typically fabric lined which helps reduce exterior noise and helps insulate the interior Some points to consider in support of having both hard and soft tops Soft Top  Substantially more road noise  especially when the top  whips  in the wind  Greater potential for drafts or leaks  Much greater risk of theft or vandalism  Deteriorates much more quickly than a hard top  especially if subjected to year round exposure to the elements  Convenience of riding with the top down while being able to take the top with you in case of rain  Easily taken on and off by one person Hard Top  Taking top on and off requires two people or purchase of a garage hoist  Top requires six bolts and can be time consuming to remove  by the way  take one of the bolts to a hardware store and look where you d find socket wrenches  You ll find the same tool  10 15 less than at the dealer  You can also buy a couple adapters and put it on a power screwdriver probably cuts the time by about 2 3  especially since those tight spaces are tough to get to with a socket wrench  Easy to get caught in a summer thunderstorm since you can t go topless and take it with you  Inconvenient on those spring and fall days when it s very cold in the mornings and evenings  but warm during the day  Need to have somewhere to store the top when it s off  Greatly reduces road noise  Makes it just as difficult to break into as a car  Reduced risk of wind or rain leaks  Rear dome light  rear window wiper  and rear defroster If you decide to go for the soft top only  you should still consider getting full steel doors  You ll get real windows that provide greater visibility  added protection  and convenience  With half doors  you ll find yourself at fast food drive throughs and toll booths having to unzip your plastic window and flip it outside a real pain on cold or rainy days  By the way  if you like the  doors off  look  the full doors come off the same way the half doors do  don t forget to buy some forward mounted side view mirrors to be legal  the stock mirrors come off with the doors Happy Jeeping br br

 I Love My Toyota  I did my research before we ever went out and looked  Consumers Report  online research  etc  Then we went out to test drive as many mini vans as we could  In my opinion the rest didn t come close  The ride is like a car  I love the room i have with my van  I have the power door which is great  Moon roof is ok  I never had one before  but when its open its just to noisy  They may all be that way  I don t know  I have been approached by total strangers that want to ask me about my Toyota  My daughter has 2 small children and I have recommended to her that they get the Toyota Sienna for their next car br br  
 This is my second Ford Explorer which I purchased in July I really enjoyed my first Explorer and never had any problems with it I love that it has so much room  I have put the back seat down and moved furniture it is amazing how much you can actually put in at one time For me there is nothing to hate  It is easy to drive and handles like a dream whether in town or on the interstate Also the 4 wheel drive is a real plus This is truly a vehicle for every one Whether a senior as I am or a family since it is so versatile  I Highly Recommend Ford Explorer br br  
  This previously written review has now been moved to its appropriate section i As you have all been pestering me for one of my used car reviews  yes it is finally here b Preface  In the early 1970s German engineers were causing quite a stir down at Porsche  Rumours had it that they were creating  gasp 133 a front engined car  The 928 was actually designed before the ill fated 924  which I will leave for another day  even though the latter went on sale before the 928  Porsche engineers realised that Americans loved V8s  and so went to the drawing boards creating the first V8 Porsche  ironically they realised the US loves  147SUVs 148 and so have recently created the hideous Cayenne Porsche fans hated the new car  after all having a front engined Porsche was something that was not done  and to some it was like attending church on a Monday  Many long term Porsche owners and fans shunned the front engined cars  saying they were not  real  Porsches  Now  all of these designs have been dropped and the company continues to make cars based on the 911 of 1963  which  itself  was based on the original 356 of 1949  Nevertheless the press loved it  and in 1978 the 928 was awarded with  147Car of the Year 148 at the Geneva Motor Show  The 928 was essentially a grand tourer  a sports car with a slight bias for luxury  The 928 is a 2 2  meaning it has two occasional seats  motor speak for uncomfortable  confining rear seating  and to many this was a large selling point of the car  It made justification of the large purchase price that bit easier  The 928 was beautifully engineered and despite the hatred it drew from Porsche fans  was a relatively successful venture  It was one of the pioneers of the  147luxury coupe 148 era experienced in the late 80s  to early 90s The model I test here today is a 1992 GTS b Appearance  7 5 10 The 928 has a very distinct body shape  and is one of the few cars around that will never date in terms of styling  The car was so avant garde at the time that even today it looks as if it is a new car  You have to remember this design is almost 30 years old  and while there were 4 updates throughout the car 146s life cycle  2 of them rather considerable  it is amazing how this car really has fared in terms of appearance Three distinguishing features of the 928 are its very large tailgate  a glasshouse design  glass is everywhere  and lack of visual bumper bars   they are actually integrated under the body work  that doesn 146t do a lot of good if you live in a place like Paris where people actually use their cars to physically shunt other cars in order to get a sufficiently large parking space  A number of the 928 146s body panels are aluminium  front wings  doors and bonnet  and this contributed to a lower weight The bonnet is unusually long which makes driving in the city a bit of a problem  as I found out  and is characterised by a personal hate of mine  150 pop up headlights which tilt flat in the bonnet when not in use  Earlier cars had less attractive fog lights but by the time 1992 came around these had been upgraded to a much nicer unit of lights  The same applies for the rear end of the car which received much nicer tail lights  in my own opinion anyway  and contributed to a much more streamlined and clean look According to the dealership I went to  928s are usually unmodified today  as many were bought by more mature persons  men in particular  that have added very little to their cars  I think it is the design myself which is complete as it is b Interior and Accommodation  21 35 b i Quality   4 5 This was definitely a strong point of the 928 series of cars  in evidence the large number of them around that are still in relatively impeccable condition  On the car I drove  which was turning eleven this November  the paintwork was still impeccable and the interior still brand new The interior in particular displays Porsche 146s fine build quality  The leather lined  147cock pit 148 on the car I tested contained few panel gaps and beautifully soft leather  which was still in remarkable condition considering it was black leather in a climate like Australia 146s However you don 146t get that solid feeling you get from other German manufacturers  The doors don 146t  147thunk 148 like a Mercedes  the controls which look positively dated haven 146t the tactile feel of Audi and material quality still isn 146t as good as BMW  particularly the plastics  Then again these are some of the reasons you buy the other cars  not a Porsche b i Ease of Use   3 5 The interior is typically Germanic in its business like set out  with controls close at hand and labelling which is clear and logical  However there are design cues  which indicate this car was designed in another era  The lines of the dashboard just don 146t seem flowing  not really much of a problem but it isn 146t exactly harmonious either  Disappointingly the steering wheel is unadjustable  but its low angle means pretty relaxed driving and is generally not a problem  As with the BMW 8 Series I drove a few months ago  the 928 is rather wide  and this makes driving in the city a problem  I imagine that before buying this car you should see if it adequately fits into your garage  as the wide opening doors and low slung body mean that you need a little bit of room to get in and out b i Seating   4 5 I particularly appreciated the well bolstered and supportive front seats in this car  which have nice lateral cushioning  This lateral cushioning  while seemingly insignificant means that you don 146t  147slide 148 down your seat  as is a common problem with cars that have leather seating  Mercedes take note Electric adjustments are standard on both seats  adjustable in eight ways  Additionally  the front seats are heated for those frosty mornings  The rear seats are rather upright  and have the significant lateral bolstering as those seats in the front  Interestingly the very large transmission tunnel has a rather overbearing effect on the rear seat passengers  rubbing on the hips and generally getting in the way b i Heating and Ventilation   2 5 5 The HVAC controls in this car are painfully old in their looks and operation  It is a simple sliding mechanism  and while there is nothing wrong with this sort of system is it really fit for such an expensive car  The climate control system is non automatic  another oversight which is ridiculous in a car of this price  Porsche has put air vents in the doors  if you can imagine air vents being installed on a cars door armrests  150 and the only good I can see in this is cooling clammy palms  In effect  the system is rather inadequate  The large glass areas attract heat like a magnet  I tested the car on an overcast day  approx 23 degrees Celsius  and was sweltering in the interior    Sound System   3 5 A 10 speaker sound system was fitted with 10 CD auto changer  Once again nothing special here  perhaps I am just spoilt from other systems  Radio reception is surprisingly good for a European car b i Safety and Security   3 5 I can only assume an airbag was fitted to this car  by the shape of the steering wheel pad and by the new car price  but if this is the case it was driver 146s side only  The 928 hasn 146t got any of the safety regalia of a Mercedes Benz or Volvo  but those superb brakes fitted would surely allow you to stop a little quicker than in other cars  The 928 is fairly solidly built  but it was designed in the 1970s so sophisticated crumple zones and the like have not been engineered in  Basically it is up to you  Immobiliser and Alarm are fitted b i Storage and Space   1 5 5 In terms of space the 928 it quite respectable  Aside from the illusion of space due to the large amount of light in the cabin  the front seats are most spacious  with plenty of elbow and foot room  However in terms of storage space  the 928 is quite pathetic  There are some deep door pockets and a big glove box  however no other storage compartments or cup holders  As this is a hatch  the luggage compartment is accessible from the rear seats  and it is interesting to note that the actual luggage compartment is much higher than the rear seats meaning parcels could possibly enter the cabin during hard braking  Porsche has thought of this and a luggage net has been incorporated so you can strap your luggage down  Inconvenient in my own opinion  A beautiful tool kit is included  be sure to look at one if you have the chance b Engine and Handling  16 20 b i Engine and Performance   7 5 10 This is definitely the 928 146s strong point  particularly in GTS specification  The 928 has had a few engines in its life  which I will explain later  but the GTS has a 5 4 litre V8  The 257kW  350 horsepower  is a beautiful engine  and even planting your foot halfway down on the accelerator results in you slamming back into your seat  The accelerator pedal is quite heavy and long of travel  which mean that smooth takeaways are easily possible  but you must learn to regulate the speed at which you plant your foot  as it is sensitive  especially to angle  100km h is reached in 5 7 seconds  There is something a little raucous about the engine note  it doesn 146t have the purr of a BMW V8  nor the scream of my F355 146s  This really is a great cruising engine  Simply point  plant foot and enjoy My car was fitted with a 4 speed automatic  as many of these cars were  The unit is generally smooth shifting  and is never caught hunting  The Porsche specialist who was selling this car told me it is a very strong transmission  with few problems  however fluids MUST be changed religiously  The torque curve of this car is amazingly flat  meaning flexible performance in any gear b i Handling   8 5 10 There is one way of describing the 928 146s handling and that is with  147balance 148  Put simply  the 928 has impeccable road manners  and while it lacks the nimble nature of smaller sports cars due to its size and weight limitations  you can 146t help but feel content with the safe yet taut handling  which is an excellent combination of luxury and sports  a balance which is hard to get  The steering should bear a special mention  it is tight  yet direct and conveys road feeling back to the driver in a positive way  It never feels overly heavy or over assisted  as seems to be the case with many cars of today  This is an excellent blend that allows for confident high speed travel and ease of use in the city  The GTS grips the road beautifully  when accelerating into corners you are merely pushed into the supportive seats  and the car remains roll and pitch free  Stability is always at an absolute optimum At the back of your mind should always be the fact that 330 horses are struggling to get out of a relatively short wheelbase car and there aren 146t any electronic Gods to save you if you happen to make a mistake  I minor complain I have with the 928 is the car 146s ride is a little harsh  which could be attributed to the rather large tires and sport suspension fitted to the GTS I drove  This however this was only experienced when travelling at lower speeds b Ownership  4 10 b i Insurance   2 5 Insurance for the 928  particularly the higher powered GTS is not cheap  In Australia rates are AUD  2000  b i Maintenance   2 5 The 928 146s complexity  not only mechanically  but also in the number of electronic aids  means there is plenty that can go wrong  Older  higher kilometre cars are most likely to experience such mechanical troubles as binding and squealing brakes  driveline vibrations and so on  Clutches eventually wear out on the manual versions  especially if hard driven  Allow for a few thousand dollars in case of emergency  you cannot afford to scrimp on these cars b i Other Considerations   The Porsche 928 came in four stages  each stage introducing a new engine 1978 1982 928 4 5 V8 1980 1985 928S 4 7 V8 1986 1991 928S4 5 0 V8 1989 1991 928GT 5 0 V8 1992 1995 928GTS 5 4 V8 Each stage had a variety of equipment additions  as well as sub stages where power and minor equipment was also added b Total Score  Appearance   7 5 10 Interior and Accommodation  21 35 Engine and Handling  17 20 Ownership 4 10 i Total  49 5 75  b Final Evaluation  The Porsche 928 represents an excellent used car buy  particularly the mid to late 1980s models  These cars are remarkably good value  with excellent performance  handling and that Porsche image for a relatively small entry fee  Some sports cars of today do not drive as well as the 928  which is an example of how well engineered this car really is The 928 is quite possibly one of Europe 146s finest grand tourers  and it must be remembered that it is exactly that

 The very first car that I financed for myself  all by myself  was a baby blue 1987 Ford Tempo  There was something about this car that I had always liked when they were new  and when I saw one on a car lot after the untimely death of my Ford Pinto  I knew that I just had to have it After a week of trying to find financing for a first time buyer with no credit  I was overjoyed to get the phone call that I had been approved for the loan  and that I could come pick up my car This car was 8 years old when I got it  and it had 79881 miles on it  but the car itself ran like a top  Whoever owned it before I got it took wonderful care of it  The interior was like new  and the engine was in excellent condition The first thing I did  was take the car to a mechanic to make sure that it was mechanically sound  With the exception of a small oil leak on the oil pan  it was in terrific shape The Tempo became my baby  Only the best gas  a detailing every payday  maintenance whenever it was recommended  It was even during some routine maintenance that I was introduced to my husband  but that is another story altogether     All in all  I had very few problems with my Tempo  One of the headlights had a short in it  and at times I had to bang on the lens to get the light to come on  The radiator went bad  I had to replace the muffler  catalytic converter  and the CV joint   But all of those conditions were just from old age and wear When I got the car up to 100 000 miles  my husband took it in to his shop and looked at the transmission  automatic  with full intentions of rebuilding it  When he got the transmission all apart  he found that it was in nearly perfect shape  and only needed a couple of clutches I think  however  that the car had it s own agenda  and had no intentions of going much further than 100 000 miles because it started to act odd  Stalling out  running rough  sucking gasoline like a hog  At 120 000  my husband had a minor fender bender  and because of the age of the car  the insurance company decided to total it out  so they gave us a check  which we took to the nearest auto mall to find a new car The Tempo got us safely to and from the auto mall  and then promptly died as my husband pulled into our driveway  It never ran again  and 3 days later  the insurance company sent a flatbed to take it away br br  
 Things I Like Although many people think I m crazy here in the heart of the snow belt  I bought a 2001 V 6 Mustang as a commuter car   and it turned out to be a good choice  After a year of ownership  some of the rough edges have smoothed out  like shifting the manual transmission into reverse  and I haven t had any major problems  Gas mileage in mixed city highway driving has improved from an initial 22 mpg to now a consistent 26 mpg  The engine won t ever get mistaken for a V 8 but insurance is cheap and it has enough power to keep up with  and many times pass  the majority of traffic at a stoplight  If you have the chance to get the 460 watt CD changer  by all means  get it  It is truly an awesome stereo  I was afraid that with only bass and treble controls  the sound would be sub par  Wow  was I wrong  Ford s really done their homework with this one  Sound throughout the audible range is well balanced and clean  The ride isn t overly stiff but handles nicely in moderate corners  The 4 wheel disc brakes do a nice job of stopping  Not sure about brake fade  I ve never had to stop repeatedly or raced it on a track  Most items are easy to get to under the hood  With 100 pounds of kitty litter in the trunk and the optional traction control on  winter driving is manageable if you take an interest in learning to control a rear wheel drive car in slippery conditions  I don t have much trouble keeping up with traffic on snowy mornings Things I Don t Like My A 1 gripe with the car is the way the accelerator hangs up during shifts  when you let off the gas and push in the clutch for a shift  the engine RPMs don t drop off  they stay high   or get higher   unless you stay off the gas for 4 5 seconds  I took it into the dealer to get it fixed only to find out that it s designed that way  It really makes you sound like you ve driving a manual transmission for all of one day  Boy racer tricks like heel and toe and controlling drift with the throttle are all but impossible due to this silly design feature  I understand that the V 8s don t have it  I sure wish mine didn t  I have the tinted clearcoat red  laser red  It s fairly obvious that the clearcoat from the factory gets kind of thin around the passenger side rear of the car  near the gas filler  The shine is noticeably shallower there  Many of the sheetmetal features don t line up very well either  They aligned the major ones well at the factory  like the creases at the bottom of the side windows  but if you look closely  others aren t very close at all  Other problems I ve had are  brownish staining on the aluminum wheels  outside rear view mirror glass getting mottled  and a minor water leak in the passenger side roll up window  Lastly  I wish Ford would have offered a fully adjustable seat on this model  The seats are comfortable enough for 1 2 to one hour trips but if they go much beyond that  I find my lower back getting fatigued  A manually adjustable lumbar support and firmer padding all around would have helped a lot  
 Standing 5 9  I don t have the headroom or legroom problems some people have with cars  The Contour was my company lease car for 2 years and I enjoyed its European handling characteristics and economy Engine The Contour LX was equipped with the Zetec 4 cylinder which was a nice match to the 5 speed manual transmission  It made the otherwise tame looking 4 door sedan quite the handler in the city  Good gas mileage  this is a once a week tank to fill Handling The Contour s strong suit   called the Ford Mondeo in Europe  the Contour is Audi like in handling  Great in curves and tight spaces  Excellent traction in wet weather or snow Interior Ergonomically superior dash unfortunately made of cheap plastic  But the gauges and dials are in the right place and the dash is very modern  The front seats were firm and comfortable though the rear seats were a bit tight for tall people  Trunk was a good size   back seats in some models can fold down for pass through space Quality I had no problems with the Contour for the 2 years of my lease Value Since the Contour has been discontinued by Ford  you can pick up a used one or new one that s deeply discounted  I think it s a very good 4 door sedan  Styling is European  Engineering is all in place  Interior space is only a concern if you re over 6  tall  
 Puschased used with 60 000 miles  This is an XLT model and is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned  In the 1st 6 months  I have driven about 10 000 miles and have had no problems  I have had to replace 2 tail light bulbs and the battery  Regular service has included power stearing fluid change  Transmission fluid change  radiator cleaned and flushed and 2 wiper blades in addition to regular oil changes with Mobil 1 5W30 motor oil  Excellent The remote outside mirrors leave no blind spots when properly adjusted  Handling is excellent  stearing is responsive and predictable  It is one of the smoothest riding vehicles I have ever owned  Twice in this time I have moved 400 and 900 miles and found the cargo capacity excellent  Even fully loaded  the handling is smooth  I like the option of opening the rear glass or the whole tailgate  The seats are cloth and very comfortable  This vehicle has power seats with lumbar and calf support which allows very comfortable adjustments  In my opinion this is an excellent choice for anyone who needs the ability to haul children and or stuff  Front Rear seating is ample and comfortable  Head and leg room superior to most I have driven  Gas mileage is good  Wind noise above 60 mph moderate Would recommend this SUV highly  Since it has dual air bags  small children should only ride in the back seat  Auto 4 Wheel drive excellent for rail snow ice br br  
 At the time we purchased this vehicle  we were trying to find a car within a reasonable amount of time  Our previous vehicle had been a Saturn  and it had been written off by the insurance company due to an accident  When we first saw the 1998 Ford Taurus  we decided that was the car we wanted because it was nice and spacious  had low miles  and had a nice quiet engine  We did not go to a Ford dealership to purchase this car  We were renting a car from a local car rental place and found out that they also sold their rental cars after a certain amount of time  The price of the care was under 15 000 which was great for us because we could have a nice care with a limited budget  These cars are purchased brand new and used as rental cars  The maintenance records and history of the se cars is accurate and up to date  The other quality I like about the 1998 Taurus is the roomy trunk  We recently took the vehicle on a long road trip to Texas and of course the car did great  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who does not want a brand new car  but does not want one with too many miles     
 Our car is in the shop  so my brother in law loaned us this SUV from his dealership  Now I am MISERABLE  I want to keep it soooo badly  With Mommy and Daddy both in school and 3 little kids we can t afford this car  SO  I will just have to enjoy it on borrowed time and hopefully help those of you who CAN afford it  make a good decision We picked up this 4WD 2000 HONDA PASSPORT a few days ago  Out of all the cars we could borrow  we picked this SUV because of the way it looks  and it s reputation  The passport looks rugged yet glossy and gorgeous  It was just the right size for our family of five to travel in to Stone Mountain Georgia this week  It is so comfortable and quiet I will probably sleep the whole way there It is large and roomy  yet easy to handle  I drove a 15 passenger van during our years of houseparenting  so I did not want to even borrow or look at  a vehicle that would be hard to drive or park This vehicle is just fun  We hauled out jet ski to the lake with it  and I know it would haul the boat easily as well  The car just oozes with style  It is sooo quiet to drive feels like riding in a luxury car It is getting better gas milage then I expected I put in 15 bucks two days ago  and have been driving all over  I still have over a quarter of a tank  We are getting about 18 mpg around town  This Honda Passport has a V6 motor  205 horse power with 214 foot pounds of torque  This means nothing to me all I know is this thing will GO It has LOTS of acceleration and pickup The car is very responsive to the driver  You barely have to give it gas  and it is on the move  The steering is tight  and very smooth even at very high speeds  This SUV has 4 wheel disk brakes and an ABS system as well  Although we did not buy this SUV  it is far sale for  26 900  It is loaded with steal alloy wheels  full spare tire  a sun roof  leather interior  a CD player  two tone paint job  and much much more When my hubby graduates in May and we are ready to buy a new car this will be IT  Thanks for reading and rating br br  
 I bought this car because it was Saturday and I needed to get to work on Monday  My other car died and I was in a jam  My wife and I knew this car salesman  so we told him to keep an eye out for us  We couldn t afford anything over  5000 at the time  so when my buddy called about the 91 Thunderbird  I jumped at the offer  We ended up paying about  4000  and the shirts off our backs Let me start by stating that I purchased this car with 97 000 miles on it and it currently has 145 000 miles  I will reveal how this car has held up after 9 years and 1145 000 miles  and what I have done to it within my first 50 000 miles This car is fun to drive  There is something about owning a T Bird with the 5 0 V8 engine  This car has everything power windows  locks  mirrors  driver s seat  rear defrost  keyless entry and alloy wheels  This car is fast too  I m sure there are some 4 cylinders that can beat it off the line  but let s see who s first to 100 mph  turbos need not apply The handling is a joke  This car likes to roll into turns no matter how slow you go  It sort of wobbles when I turn  It s not visible wobble  but it feels like it moves from side to side while turning  This got better after I purchased new tires for it  but it s starting to happen again with only about 30 000 miles on the new tires  Apparently  this car only likes brand new tires  Make no mistake  this car is not a sports car  Sure  it has a 205 hp V8  but the car is just to heavy and long  It bounces over bumps  and you ll feel every one  The steering wheel likes to shimmy too  Again  this may fix itself when I replace the tires At first  the car s finish has held up very well  There is little rust to speak of  The only visible rust is due to a bent corner on the driver s door  I m not sure how the guy before me bent that  There is also some rust along the bottom of the doors  This is only visible if the doors are open and you actually look at the underside of the doors  There are a few specks of peeling paint on the black trim on the front bumper  The trunk lines don t seem to fit together evenly  but I suspect the guy before me was in a slight accident  Now  the clearcoat is beginning to peel on the roof  After 150 000 miles though  you can t be too surprised The interior has held up very well too except the front seats  There are no cracks or blemishes in the entire dash board and there is no fading either  The only part of the interior that shows any sign of wear are the seats  which are very worn and uncomfortable  The rear arm rests are bulging out of their notches too  and the release levers on the front seats are busted  You can move the seats forward without using the levers  That s not a big deal though Speaking of broken  the rear defrost took that path around 100 000 miles  The fluid monitoring system is gone too  I think the transmission missed the rear defrost  because it went around the same time  It took with it 3 02 sensors  some belts and hoses  the water pump  the power steering assembly  a turn signal assembly and some fuel lines  The mechanic actually said there had been a fume fire on my gas tank  I think I might have bent over on that one  but who knows  I think my tires are getting lonely  I will have to replace them in a few weeks  The passenger automatic seat belt is possessed  I just try not to upset it I have spent about  6000 in repairs from August 1999  to May of 2003  It has been trouble free for the past few months  knock  knock  At least the dealership where I bought it from agreed to pay for half of my new transmission  which I had repaired elsewhere  That s a Toyota dealership for you The speedometer only goes to 85 mph  That s pretty wimpy for a V8  I ve had the thing burried way past 85  The radio rots  I m not sure if it s just old  or if radios weren t that good 10 years ago  There is an absolute lack of bass  My voice can go lower than these 6x9s  I just put in a Kenwood CD player and some Polk speakers  Even these entry level items are a vast improvement I may be crazy  but I love my T Bird  Despite it s shortcomings  there s just something about driving a V8 T Bird  I will definitely miss this car when it s time to trade it in for a familymobile I would recommend this car as a first car for people in high school because it is a cheap car to buy  the resale value is horrible  but the V8 would get them into trouble and the V6 is laughable  It would make a good car for a single person or a couple who isn t ready  smart enough  to purchase a Camry UPDATE  07 31 00 The new tires solved the wobbly turns and the shimmying steering wheel  This car handles much better now  so forget those negative comments I made about the handling  This car does handle more like a sports car now than it did  It is still a little off balanced as far as weight distribution  but the handling has improved  Check out my review of the Firestone Firehawk tires UPDATE  09 09 00 Well  the starter went out so I had to replace that  116 000 mile isn t too bad for something like that  That brings the grand total for the repair bill to about  4500 since I bought this car in August of 99  I m not liking this car so much UPDATE  01 03 00 Well  some clamp came loose on the radiator which caused some antifreeze to spill out  Not too bad  only  30 UPDATE  06 03 01 The airconditioner needed to be recharged  Figures  Another  80 down the drain   120 000 miles UPDATE  01 30 02 The O2 sensors needed to be replaced again  This is the third time in 30 000 miles UPDATE  06 11 02 I put in another 2 grand into this thing  I replaced the shocks  oil pan  and a bunch of brake junk  I had to recharge the A C again  which is becoming an annual event  The Check Engine light comes on for no reason I must say  the car rides so much better now that I have replaced the shocks  I also had to replace the tire rods and a buch of crap related to that  The car s more quiet now and rides much stiffer  It s nice  Still  make sure you don t buy one of these things with 100k miles on it UPDATE  05 12 03 I have edited some of the content  
 The Jeep Cherokee would make its namesakes proud  The Cherokee is strong  sturdy and dependable  I recently got a Cherokee  after driving a minivan for seven years  I was worried about the loss of the second back seat  but after a few packing and seating adjustments  it was not a problem  I took the Cherokee on a trip through the Georgia and Alabama hills  and conformably fit five happy passengers  The Jeep is powerful  and can reach the speed limit in great time  It is also steady on the curves  and never once felt top heavy or hard to manage  I drove through torrential downpours on unfamiliar roads  and felt completely safe  The wipers were high powered  and the Jeep hugged the road  The extras included in the Jeep are luxurious  remember  I ve been driving a van for a long time  including a CD player  a niche for your garage door opener  and sunglasses compartment  an extra power outlet  auto locks and power windows  Although I occasionally miss the second back seat  well  actually my dog does  the Jeep Cherokee has been a comfortable and dependable vehicle to be proud of br br  
 My husband was transferred from Indiana to Georgia and decided my poor little Tracer just wouldn t make it on the racetracks they call highways in Georgia  He had one free day to go to the dealership and trade it for something  quot bigger  better  faster quot  He came home with a new Contour  I have been driving this car for over two years now and I love the fact that it keeps up with the 90 mph traffic on the highways  It does have a little more interior space than my Tracer  But I have had no less than 7 recalls on this car over the last 2 years  Some of them were for minor problems  but some of them were serious enough to have killed me or someone else  I also had a problem that wasn t even on the recall list  I would probably be much less upset about this had we not paid so much for this car  We paid over  16 000 for this car and the only options we got were air conditioning  not really an option in Georgia  and a rear spoiler  No power anything  no tape or cd player  etc  I MISS MY TRACER br br  
 I bought my Explorer for basically one main reason  More Space  I had previously owned a 1995 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP 2 door and its small back seat was cramping for my large dog  Max   He now has plenty of windows to look out and tons of room to move around as he desires  It s also nice being able to go to Sam s Club and fit everything I  my mother    my sister purchase into one car  This SUV has outweighed my expectations  It heats up quickly in freezing weather  has minimal maintenance problems  and smooth ride  This vehicle fits into my life well I am very much amazed at the reliability of my Explorer  I bought my 1996 Ford Explorer used in September  2001 with 120 000 miles on it  and two days ago it hit 130 000  I was amazed to have gone 10 000 miles without a single problem except for nails in my tire  Those 10 000 miles weren t easy either  mostly driving through downtown Chicago s bumpy streets on my way to college  This vehicle also has plenty of room for all necessary activities  Shopping  Clothes   Groceries  nights out in downtown Chicago  carting around my 80 Lb Chocolate Laborador  helping friends move  driving to school  camping  etc  etc  This vehicle s looks are stylish and rugged at the same time and perfect for any occasion  My ONLY complaint with this vehicle is its horrible gas consumption  I drive approximately 200 miles a week  City   Suburb  and have to fill the 17 Gallon tank up each week  All of the Ford Explorer s amenities outweigh this one drawback  and make me feel completely satisfied with this purchase  
 My wife and I bought our 98 4Runner from our friends as they were switching vehicles and didn t want to trade it in  It only had 17000 miles on it  It had appealed to me because it looked good  had a 4 cylinder engine for better gas mileage  and I knew would be good mechanically  I was right about these things  But after owning it for a few months I began to dislike the thing  First  acceleration is very slow and strained with the four  The SR5 V6 will be better  Seats are uncomfortable  but ride quality and freeway noise are the worst of any SUV I ve ever ridden in or driven  and that s alot  Went on vacation to Florida and actually was getting motion sickness in this vehicle  bumpy and jittery ride  Felt relieved to make it back home  After the trip we agreed to get rid of it  Also  the cupholders are flimsy  thin plastic  they broke  and placed right in front of the a c controls and vent  so you have to move them if you want to make a c adjustments  Poor engineering throughout the inside  Toyota may have improved since 1998 with the 4Runner  and their engines are superior to most domestics  I am an auto tech  but they remain light years behind Ford s Explorer Expedition and GM s Suburban in ride comfort and interior engineering in my opinion  Most full size SUV s are body on frame  which would preclude a somewhat stiff ride  but this one was like an old pickup truck  Check out Ford s 2002 and later SUV s for independent rear suspension and ride in one  you will see the difference it makes  I don t recommend this particular year of Toyota for a good choice  
 The Pontiac Montana was exactly what our family needed  We d been driving my  89 Buick LeSabre way  way too long  With my son in school and both of us on the PTA and activities for both children ramping up and  and We needed a new car  Oddly enough  we had discussed purchasing a minivan  especially the Oldsmobile Silhouette  safe  spacious  economical  well  not in terms of gas  but in terms of initial costs  great for trips  But then  on a trip to New Mexico  we had rented a Mitsubishi Montero  Oooh  Aaah  We liked that vehicle very much  and for a while  my wife kept talking about how she wanted an SUV  Like that Montero we rented  Yea  I wouldn t have minded But then  the day we went looking  at the very first place we stopped  they had one lone Pontiac Montana sitting in the lot  It was a 1999   one year old   with about 14K miles on it  And it was marked a little below retail  as I quickly had a friend go online and blue book it We test drove it  Nice power  good handling  roomy  comfortable  To make a short story even shorter  we bought it that afternoon  Since then  we have driven it from St  Louis to New Mexico and back  We have hauled numerous families to Six Flags and the zoo  We have moved stuff back and forth from storage to home  And through it all  it has performed beautifully We love our Montana  People tell us what a good looking minivan it is and we bask in the glow  It s a great vehicle for the money and I totally give the thumbs up seal of approval However   you knew that was coming  didn t you  I mean  no opinion could be complete without a reference to the imperfections marring all that exists around us  However  there are a couple of things that have bugged me  and I just want to spell them out real quick like  Molding came loose from doors  covered under warranty  Plastic sliding door track holder doohicky came loose  covered under warranty  Second cigarette light  for use without having ashtray open  loose fitting on standard plugs  Haven t checked on this yet However   hah  I got you  You thought I was finished  didn t you  you wild and crazy people  However  there are also some neat features that apparently came standard on it as well  Here  won t let you turn on the lights if you have the parking brake on  useful at night  seats are  really  easy to take out  the drink holders are pretty sturdy  much more so than any Buick I ve seen  For some reason  Buicks just all seem to come with poorly designed cup holders and for the life of me  I can t figure out why All in all  if you are looking for a good quality minivan at a reasonable price  the Montana will meet your needs and surpass your expectations br br

 I will answer these questions   1 I bought the car because it looked great  had a lot of options  and my college buddies had vw s with millions of miles on them so I thought reliabitiy would still be high  Well  it has been in the dealer for 2 solid months now and absolutly no answer from the dealer  I guess the bright spot is is that I now have an extremely low milage car  They did give me a truck of all things for me to drive in the meantime  I have had the ck engine light on since I bought it last Sept  and now it s June 1  Most of the problems really are from the dealer but they are a reflection of vw  VW trains these guys to deal with customers and any problems but I think they need a little more training   2 I don t remember what is like to drive it  I think I do remember it was nice  only when it ran good and no warning light on the dash but I m really not sure 3 Maybe someone but  no one I like  Like I said  most of the problem stems from the dealer and this is the only dealer around here so for my area I would not recomend  Unless they want to waste time with Ohio Arbritration  and then a lawyer  By the way BOTH vw and the dealer were notified about me sueing them about a month ago  They only have a week or two now to reply and if they don t  I automatically win the judgement by default  Email at garbers2 nationwide com for any help or questions you may need or want br br  
 After owning a 1992 Honda Accord I was sold on the accord series  I was impressed by my Accord but left wanting more due to its poor interior and A C  a major factor in Houston  However  I am not nearly as impressed by the new accord  It seems like the pros and cons of my older accord have swapped with the pros cons of the newer accord  While I have not been particularly   dissapointed   by this accord  I have certainly not been   impressed   as I was with the old one    The Pros   Honda has certainly taken heed to the complaints regarding the old accord  The shoddy interior that was prominent with the older models has been replaced with an almost luxurious interior  although I should note I have the leather model  The interior shows no signs of fading or peeling  the leather feels as soft and pleasant now as it did when I bought it  Mileage is also fairly good  although a bit under my older accord  Once again  the accord takes the throne regarding reliability  2 years into it and I have yet had a single problem    The Cons   As I mentioned in the beginning  all the good features of my 1992 accord seemed to have become the cons in my new accord  It all begins with the engine they claim the new VTEC adds power  economy  and driveability  I can certainly say the engine has none of these  To begin with  this is one of the most underpowered cars I have ever driven  It is   OK   on the street  but it really starts to bog on the highway  Heaven forbid you try to pass anybody on the highway  I tried it once  punching the accelerator at about 65 mph    absolutely nothing    I couldn t believe it  the car made plenty of noise but I was literally inching on the car I was trying to pass  Passing on the street OR highway was a simple matter with my old accord  but you really have to plan ahead with the new model Not only does the new engine disappoint  but now you feel detached from the entire car  The steering is soft and unresponsive  The car feels much heavier and lacks any low end torque  it feels more like an 18 wheeler then a small sedan  The seats are much better material  but they are not as comfortable as the older models My final complaint is the cost of body repairs  I got in a   minor   scrape with another car  I was hit by another car that idled into me from behind  The rear bumper was not dented but some paint was scraped off  You would think this would be 100  200 dollars at the most  Boy did my jaw drop when   they wanted  600     I would hate to think how much it would cost if you got in a real accident with this car  Needless to say  I m still driving around with some scraped paint  It is hard for me to believe a minor paint touch up like this could cost  600  this was at a Honda dealership  This is certainly not a luxury car that requires rare body panels    Conclusion   The new accord has improved in some areas  but has fallen behind in many others  The Accord is no longer a cheap  reliable  and fun car that it was a mere decade ago  True  it is closer to a luxury car  But in striving to become one  it has lost its touch  I m afraid I m no longer an Accord fan  
 The F 250 Power stroke diesel is the best truck I have ever owned  I use this truck to pull a horse trailer and have found the transmission  automatic  reliable without a problem of jerky the horses around in the trailer  The mileage I have gotten with this truck in unbelievable compared to having always driven gas engines  as high as 22 mileage per gallon on the highway compared to 12 14 with the gas engine  I would recommend this truck for anyone that wants to haul a horse trailer as it is dependable and economical for its purchase price  Since owning a power stroke I would never purchase another gas powered vehicle again  It is good looking with very pleasing colors to select from  Comfortable for a women to drive  which is a plus for so many of us out there hauling our own horses  Many trucks interiors are not designed to be comfortable for a women and this one seems to fit me well and my husband also is comfortable in this truck with there being a foot difference in our height and 100 pounds difference in our weight  It is an all around great truck  This is a truck that  quot likes to work quot br br  
 I have a 1990 Ford Escort LX  I bought it used six years ago when it had only 52 000 miles on it  It is probably one of the ugliest body styles Ford has ever made  but it is probably one of the most reliable cars I have experienced  Currently  it has 179 000 miles on it and it STILL starts on the first hit 95  of the time  The AC is ice cold so summer heat has not been a problem  It is very easy to work on  All I have done is change the oil  timing belt  spark plug wires  and the brake pads  It is kept clean always  but it still is unattractive  The only annoying problem besides the car being annoyingly slow is the strange shudder that the transmission is making when I hit the gas fast  The handling is terrible  but if I want to go over a long distance I do not have to worry if the car is going to make it or not  I am just waiting for this car to just stop one day either from extreme mileage for an American car of this time period or if it ever wrecked  I have a new car now anyway but I just use this one to keep the mileage of off the new car  
 I purchased a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3  S2 model  not too long ago and I absolutely love it  I couldn t ask for a better vehicle  I previously owned a 1999 Mercury Cougar  It was a great car until it started having problems  I haven t had a single problem with the ZX3 yet  Ford really did a great job designing the Focus  It has a sporty yet sophisticated look to it  The model I bought had a MSRP of  16420  This included everything that I wanted  convenience group  power group  and S2 group  which I greatly recommend for  600  The S2 group includes premium 16  wheels and 50 series tires  premium gauges  S2 diamond pattern seats  6 disk in dash cd changer  bucket seats  rear spoiler  chrome exhaust tip  European tuned suspension  and everything that the sports group offers  Not a bad deal for  600  The other groups included power everything and such amenities as A C  keyless entry  tilt and telescoping steering wheel  cruise control  etc  As you can tell  it is a lot for the money  There is no other car that offers this much at a reasonable price  The driving experience is excellent  I opted for the 5 speed manual transmission in my ZX3 although an 4 speed auto is optional  The ride is exceptionally smooth for a small car due to its 4 wheel independent suspension  Even when cruising in the highway at 70 mph the wind and road noise is minimal  Inside the car the controls are nicely layed out and within perfect reach  Headroom in the car is abundant even for someone over 6  tall  The seats provide great support and room  even with 5 adults in the car  The rear hatch provides enough room for storage  but with the split rear seats folded down the is a whoping 18 5 cubic feet of space  That s enormous for a hatchback  The only thing that Ford could do to improve the car is have a more powerful engine offered  Perhaps a 2 5 liter  The 2002 SVT model will remedy this but is going to carry a more expensive price tag at  18 500  
  M aking its first debut as a concept car in 1993  the Impala SS gained such a response from the general public that it was put into production a few years later  With a Corvette Camaro Firebird Caprice Roadmaster LT1  350 cubic inch V8 engine  and a tight suspension  this is one of the most exciting huge sedans of the mid 1990s i Driving Impressions i   Big Z rated tires   a healthy LT1 350 V8 engine and a relatively stiff suspension make the Impala SS a very fast large car  especially with its sleeper appearance  On back roads  and down the freeways the Impala s ride is superb  Although it retains a live axle  the Impala is well behaved  though oversteer is very easy to induce   Acceleration  is this car s forte  and with 260 hp  25 less than the 1996 Z28  from its LT1 V8  this SS can blast past traffic right up to 100 MPH without any fuss  however this speed is not recommended  save it for the track  This OHV V8 is coupled with a GM 4L60 E 4 speed automatic  Huge 12 inch  four wheel disc brakes gives astonishing stopping power  Unlike the Corvette Engine  the Impala unit has cast iron heads and exhaust manifolds  resulting in 260 wild horses  It featured Multipoint fuel injection  and electronic engine control and ignition  This engine can rocket the SS s Mass to 60 mph in under 7 seconds  according to specs  Chevrolet engineers saw the potential of the Chevrolet Caprice as the basis for a huge performance sedan  Stiffer springs  and anti roll bars are fitted  and  de carbon  shocks improve the ride and handling  Heavy duty police spindles and huge 12 inch disc brakes give excellent stopping ability  All this  and exterior modifications  turned the sedate Caprice into the Impala SS i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the Impala SS is relatively luxurious  it s no Cadillac but for the price you don t expect it to be one  The leather is made of high quality  the bucket seats are very supportive and comfortable  and there is tons of room everywhere  The Impala boasts power everything  including power seats  antenna  windows and door locks  Automatic headlamps  tilt steering  and a floor mounted shifter that was all new standard equipment for 1996  the Impala s last year in production  The Impala also comes with a 6 speaker premium sound system that sounds excellent The overall Interior set up is of relatively high quality  however GM was not exactly known for making a super luxurious automobiles in 1996 and the Impala SS is no exception  The plastics seem cheap and the dash seems dated for the  96 model year  The Impala has a stark black interior which helps hide some of these underpinnings  this doesn t hide the fact that GM could have improved the Impala s interior a great deal  I would have also liked to have seen much more bolstering with the seating for aggressive driving   Exterior Innovation i The  exterior  looks much like a regular Chevrolet Caprice  but there are differences  The Impala comes with different headlights  tail lights  larger tires  and that Impala SS badge of honor written on the rear side of the car  There is also 3 little badge s in the form of an impala on 1 of each of the rear sides  and the other larger one on the rear of the car  The Impala SS comes standard with sexy alloy rims  and dual exhaust   I love dual exhaust  Unfortunately the tail pipes point down  like on much cheaper cars  i e the regular Caprice Classic  A straight pipe with chrome tips would have been a nice visual feature i Pricing i  Aimed at a small band of enthusiasts  and only built for 3 model years  the Impala SS has gained a small cult following  A few cars are going for more than their original sticker prices because of the demand for these cars  Expect a  96 Impala SS to set you back around  20 000 30 000  New these cars were around  25 000  so resale is excellent  I forecast that these cars will go up further in value as the years pass by  I can not comment on reliability  Although I would love to own one  I don t  and driving one 2 times would not give me grounds to rate in this category  I suggest talking to a non selling owner before buying one i Conclusion i  With high levels of performance  and exclusivity the Impala is recommended  Looking for an equally fast yet much more refined family vehicle  You might want to check out    a href content 95796825732  my review on the Accord Coupe a    Happy Car Shopping 
 I love my truck  After my last vehicle   a kia  my Mazda B3000 is terrific  Not perfect  but definitely a good  tough truck  I have the B3000  5 speed standard  4x4  extended cab  No power package which I definitely regret  The B3000 is a big  little truck  If you re under 5 4 or so in height  you won t be able to reach across the seat to lower the window  The power package also makes it easy to adjust the side mirrors  a plus if more than one person drives the vehicle I bought the truck after much internet and consumer complaint site searching  The Mazda was highly rated by consumer reports both for safety and lack of mechanical problems  The long term picture on the Mazda indicates it is a truck that will last  I liked the ability to switch to four wheel drive without going outside the truck  A definite plus if you are in snowbound areas  Nice throw ins are that it comes standard with a bed liner  slide window in the back and a cd player  The steering wheel is adjustable  nice for smaller people  The fold up seats in the cab are small  but support the average size adult  They also come with seatbelts  which is a good touch  Two adults would be cramped  legs on top of each other  A couple kids would be fine  More importantly to me  the extended cab holds my three dogs  a 100  lab mix  35  spaniel mix and a second 35 pounder akita mix  With the dogs  having extra doors on each side to get into the back of the cab is a very important advantage The front seat supposedly can seat three when the middle combination arm rest and storage box  change  cds  is pushed up  however three is stretching it unless the middle person is a small child  A disadvantage is the seatbelt connectors for the two main seats are unmovable  making it impossible to slide them down between the two seat cushions  Nothing to noticeable unless you want to sack out on the seat for a nap or slide your sweetie over next to you The sound on the CD player is pretty good for a factory included system  There is a shuffle button  however I ve been unsuccessful in figuring out how to make it shuffle songs even following the owner manual directions  The cd radio has an automatic turnoff if the system components are getting too hot which is possible with extended play   like a cross country road trip  The player will turnoff if components reach a temperature of 167 degrees  On a 1000 mile road trip  the cds and face of the player became so hot that I could barely touch the player or the cds  I m not sure the temperature safety was working and couldn t get a dealer to verify it was Maintenance is pretty easy  requiring not much more than oil changes every 3000 miles and occasional tire rotations  When the truck hits 15 000 miles  coolant is checked and a few things require lubing  The first tuneup isn t until 100 000 miles The truck is set high  so smaller people may have a problem loading into the bed  With an old dog  you ll have to build a ramp because it might not be able to manage the jump  The bed has four tiedowns  one in each corner  I d like two more  in the center of each side but that isn t a big thing Off road  I didn t experience any problems  The truck handles well and with an empty bed  very little fishtailing  I took the truck all over Death Valley in January with not a single problem The only drawback to the B3000 is the V6 engine doesn t live up to its promise of power  really slowing down climbing across the Sierra Nevada and ranges of Utah  Without the tow package  don t consider pulling anything up even a small hill  Better yet  just go for the B4000 and its bigger engine The only bad design is how the AC heat is configured  The air conditioner compressor is engaged regardless of where you turn the selector switch  The only exception is for the vent  however you can t change the temperature of the air coming in  When you run the heat  you have to adjust the temperature selection to hot  however the AC compressor still is active  The AC compressor is what will limit your gas mileage a bit Finally  the gas mileage isn t the best  but isn t the worst either  I get about 17 mpg in the city  Straight highway though I was almost doubling that to about 27   35 mpg on the flat land  The tank capacity is 19 5 gallons  The refuel light comes on with a several gallon reserve All in all  the Mazda B3000 is a tough little truck  With this one  I don t expect to be shopping for a vehicle again for another 100 000 miles or more br br  
 I bought this vehicle  Honda CRX  because i have always love the size and body style  I always wanted a car that was small but still very comfortable  the CRX automatic or manual transmission is a great first car  but because it is listed as a sports car the insurance is higher although i love my car there are still a few things that could make it a better buy  the CRX is a two seater so that limits company  as for how it handles  it is very easy to handle smooth shifting for manual transmissions  As for automatic transmissions I was surprised at the power it had  It is a four cylinder so parents you do not have to worry about buying your child a rocket for there 16 or 18 birthday  As for air bags the two CRX s that I own  They did not have airbags I am not sure if you can get them with air bags  otherwise they are very safe and solid cars  great car for a beginner but it does have power and if you think you child or yourself has have a heavy foot i do not recommend this car other wise you will not regret it    
 First  let me say  my husband and I did not buy this vehicle  We did go with his mother when she bought it  but we tried to discourage her from this purchase  At the time  we just thought she was spending too much money on the vehicle when she could have used that money elsewhere   but that s another story Mom HAD to have this vehicle  She loved the body style and the BIGNESS of the truck  For some reason she just loved Dodge  The first vehicle she ever bought new was a Dodge  Her experiences with this vehicle  and now our experiences since we inherited it from her  have made me decide to NEVER buy a Dodge  She received at least two recall notices on this truck in the first couple years she owned it For one thing  the power windows and locks stopped working just a few years after purchasing the vehicle  This is very irritating to me because only the driver can roll the windows up and down  Another problem she had was that the windows leaked  She had her truck parked outside on a rainy day while she was working  and came outside to find the carpet was soaked  Dodge fixed her window  but did not replace the carpet so she had to deal with the stale odor of wet flooring for a long time  There was also an odor problem when using the air conditioning The biggest point of frustration to my husband is the shocks  or lack of them  Even after replacing the shocks twice the truck bounces around like a superball on the freeway  My husband commutes over a hundred miles each day to work and feels like a milk shake when he gets home A minor irritation  the cup holders in the dash are completely inadequate  It doesn t matter what size cup you insert into the holder  as soon as you turn a corner the whole cup tilts out of the holder  This makes for some very sticky messes if you forget to hold onto your drinks Sure  the truck is roomy and looks nice  but what good is that when you sacrifice that  quot new car smell quot  and conveniences such as power windows and locks br br  
 I purchased my first ever brand new car from Kip Killmon s Tyson s Ford in Vienna  VA in October 2001  The experience at the dealership was straightforward and pleasant  I got a dark green ZX3 with the power   premium package  manual transmission  ABS  side airbags  and sunroof  I paid  16 800  MSRP was  17 600 and invoice was  16 500  so I think I got a pretty good deal  One top of that I got a 60 month loan with no down payment and 0  interest The Focus comes in 3 body styles  sedan  wagon  and 3 door hatchback  zx3  There are several trims levels for each  with everything from bare bones LX to a fully loaded ZTS sedan with leather  The 2 engine choices are a 110 and 130 horsepower dual overhead cam 2 0 inline 4 cylinder  I would highly recommend you get the larger engine  especially if you are getting an automatic transmission  Starting in 2002 you can also get a 5 door hatchback  ZX5  and a pocket rocket  or  rice rocket  if you prefer  SVT 3 door hatchback  There were a few model changes between the 2000  2001  and 2002 models  but they are minor The first thing you will notice about a focus is the styling  Ford likes to call it  New Edge  Some people love it  some hate it  and I suspect if you count yourself in the later group then you have already made up your mind that the focus is not for you  and you won t be reading this review Now if you can get past the styling  or if you really like it  like I do  then the second thing you will notice about a focus is the interior  Everything is in its place  and the quality of the interior materials is above average for a small car  For example  the climate control knobs use silicon dampeners  which normally you only find in more expensive cars  Also  the turn signal stalk has a nice heavy feel to it  It doesn t feel like it s going to break off in your hand like I have noticed with many GM products The radio is right where it should be  ABOVE the climate controls  and the seats are very comfortable  The driver s seat even has a crank you can twist to raise and lower the seat  so you don t feel like you are sitting on the floor Now if you turn the key and start the engine  you will be in for another surprise  Yes it s a 4 cylinder  and nobody is going to mistake it for a V8 Mercedes  but as 4 cylinders go it s fairly quiet at idle and doesn t create a lot of vibration   sit in a Focus at Idle and then go sit in a Chevy Cavalier or Hyundai Accent and you will see what I mean Now comes the really fun part which is driving the focus  While nobody would call it a sports car  except perhaps in SVT form  it is certainly sporty  and can hold it s own on winding roads  especially with the larger 16 inch tires  One the highway it s stable and sure footed  and sound is kept out better than most cars in it s class  Compared to the escort  the Ford car it replaced  the Focus is light year s ahead  The 5 speed manual transmission does not have the snik snik precision of a BMW  Honda  or VW  but it s the best domestic gearbox I ve ever driven  and was much better than the Toyota Corolla I test drove  On the negative side  the Focus has been recalled in the past 3 years with an alarming frequency  While none of these recalls are what I would consider to be  serious   as in  Don t go over 50 miles an hour or your engine will explode  if you are buying a used one you should be sure all the recalls have been taken care of  This would only apply to buying a car from a private person  as a dealer is required to take care of all recalls before they put the car on their lot  To be fair in my review here are a few features you will NOT find on the focus that you can find on other small cars The glove box does not lock There is not much room by the spare tire to store anything The cup holders don t accommodate extra large bottles The engine is not as smooth under hard acceleration as in some other models The change drawer ashtray is kind of a dumb design Depending on how you like to shift  the armrest might interfere Ford s standard bumper to bumper warranty is only 3 years 36 000 miles You are buying a car from the same company that builds the Excursion monstrosity All in all I give the Focus a solid 4 out of 5  It s not perfect  but it s darn good  and when you look at everything put together I think Ford s small car is better than anything else out there in this price range  
 I don t buy vehicles very often  The last new one I bought was a 1981 Bronco  which I drove for nearly twelve years  through mud and snow  on the highway  in town and out  The brakes weren t great  and the engine seals leaked oil  but those could be fixed  The rust that ate the tailgate  the quarter panels  the hood and the fenders  was more of a problem  Then I bought a used 89 Bronco  It was fancier  had some extra  quot convenience quot  items  and burned more gas  It also rusted  just as bad as the 81  perhaps worse  as it was only 10 years old when I got rid of it  But both Broncos hauled stuff big time  I could take a Boy Scout troop camping  with their gear  I towed a 21 foot boat a thousand miles in the winter  and felt in control every foot of the way  Great vehicles  too bad Ford thought they had to do something different  I bought a new 2000 Explorer Sport  and after a month  I miss the Bronco more and more  Nothing has gone wrong  but the Explorer is not a truck  The cargo space looks tiny to me  I bang my knees on the steering wheel  my hand won t fit between the seat and the door  there isn t any room in the console for much beyond CDs  There is lots of power  the mileage is better  and there are a lot more toys such as power mirrors and a compass to play with  but the bumpers are plastic  the auto 4WD thumps if you do a U turn in the street  and I have the feeling this little bag of tricks is going to cost a lot of dollars if it is to survive ten years  I miss my Bronco br br  
 This product has proven completely reliable  comfortable and utilitarian  and I highly recommend an Explorer for a family or adventurer  Either the V 8 power or the V 6 is great  I ve had both  and the V 8 has full time all wheel drive  which is helpful for those of us who commute in snowy climates  It s a strong engine which warms up quickly and started yesterday after sitting in a parking lot for 60 hours in five degree temperatures The creature comforts  like heated leather seats  are wonderful and make for comfortable driving trips  The rear seats fold easily and cargo is protected by an easily removable cargo cover  Driving position is comfortable for my 6 3 quot  frame and also for my smaller friends I haul all sorts of things  and pull a three place snowmobile trailer  with sleds  with no problem I highly recommend the Explorer for the demanding consumer who wants a long term reliable vehicle br br  
 We own a 1994 Ford Explorer with the Eddie Bauer package  It s a great looking vehicle  all the comforts you d want  Leather seats  Lumbar  electronic everything  The most expensive component was the A C  It eventually started getting warmer and warmer and this year we took it in to be charged  Well  that model already used R 134  But Ford charges a fortune for it  Plus that had to  fix  the leak  where ever that was  A truck that s 8 years old didn t just spring a leak  They could have charged it up and it would have lasted another 8 years  But instead  they  fixed it  and the bill was  1200  Then a week later  when it finally got warm enough to use the A C  I tried it and the car died at 55 miles per hour  I had to steer up a hill and off the road  The compressor went out  AFTER THE FIRST USE  So back the the repair shop and  650 later we had A C  for two weeks  Then it quit being cold  We took it back and their new compressor had gone out  but I made them pay for repair  Another big headache was the Four Wheel Drive  I need the four wheel drive daily because I live atop a large  rocky hill  You push the button and the light comes on and you go up the hill  Well eventually it got harder and harder to climb and then you d have to romp up it in order to get home  Well  after spending  450 in tires in one year  I took it in  the Ford dealer told me they just get old and lose their power  Well I wasn t exactly convinced  I jacked it up and there was no power at all  I took it to a mechanic and he found the automatic hubs to be bad  Well  with the Explorer  you have to get them from Ford  no aftermarket available  So for  400 a tire I got my 4WD back  My last Chevy cost me  129 for a pair of hubs from Warn and I was back on the road  but it cost over  900 to get the Explorer working again  The vehicle has plenty of great featurs and it s comfortable  but the modern technology comes at a great price as it ages  
 My husband and I got our first Ford in 1993 for  1900 00  I was not to happy about it but my husband thought this was a great deal so we did Don t tell him this  It was the best deal we have ever made  We probably would still own it but a 90 year old man ran two red lights going 65 miles per hour and hit us and totaled out our car  Almost totaled out me too  But when the time came to get a NEW car guess what your right another brand new FORD ESCORT  After that accident I was so afraid to get behind the wheel of a car that I did a research of ALL kinds of different models and makes  A bit scared of the Ford Escort but after research I realized it was not the Escort fault that I got hurt so bad it was just the way we we re hit  The 84 Escort did not have air bags in my case would not have helped because I was T Bone hit on the driver side  So today My Escort has air bags in which I did research and for sure air bags can save life  Sometimes they can do injury but not take your life but in some instances could not be helped  Also each door has a set of intrusion bars in which would have saved me from so much damage to my body  This was put in the Escort 1990 and each one after  I know I might not get hit again but I truly know when I get into my Ford Escort I will be as safe as I could be  We just have to try to KEEP the safety of others and ourselves on the roadway DON T DRIVE DRUNK  DON T DRIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS INCLUDING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DRIVE SAFE br br  
 I have expressed my dislike of SUVs in many of my earlier reviews  but as long as my relatives continue to buy them  I will continue to write of my displeasure when driving them  Ford s Expedition is now sadly a  quot mid size quot  SUV despite the fact that it in itsself is a monstrosity  The car  with its massive size offers an unwanted guarantee that it will kill the passengers of any car you come into collision with  My closest friend s husband died in a collision with an explorer  a smaller car  and the child driving the Explorer is still emotionally wounded  However  it still is ridiculously flimsy  and suffered  2500 of damage once in a five mph collision with a garage door  Of course my biggest pet peeve is mpg  This car gets a ridiculously low mpg of nearly 10 in the city  I think it would be more environmentally sound to clear cut ten acres of rain forest then drive an Expedition around for ten years  As usual  I have experienced another SUV and grown to hate it  I recommend buying any car that will not waste fuel and kill passengers of other cars you may collide with br br  
 In October of 2000 I bought a 1993 Ford Probe GT and it is the best car of its kind  I love the front room and the hatch room but no one can fit in back unless they are under 4  I dislike the performance probably cuz I m used to my old Mustang 5 0  Off the start  it aint to bad  but after 3rd you just get blown away if you don t have mods which I am in the process of putting on  Overall  the looks kick ass  and I would recommend the car for anyone who doesn t have 60 000 for a corvette br br  
 I wanted a car that was not too flashy but still had lots of features  like leather  power everything  etc  The Malibu fit the bill at literally thousands less than its Japanese competitors  Lower price plus lower interest rates equals much lower lease rates  so the Accord  Camry and Altima worked out to be much more expensive The LS with the leather package is the way to go  It includes a half decent radio with cassette and CD  cruise  power seat  windows  door locks and mirrors  remote keyless entry  a sunroof  auto headlights  etc  I wish GM had included heated seats  which are becoming the norm in at least the upscale model of most family sedans  I commend GM for including programmable automatic door locks  but I wish they had included a couple more lines of software code for a mode that unlocks the locks when you shift into park  The only options for automatic unlocking require the car to be turned off before the locks will unopen  a nuisance when picking up and dropping off  On the other hand I could have done without the spoiler that is mandatory with the leather package  The spoiler doesn t do much for the looks or handling of this car  I think it looks kind of silly on what is obviously a bland family hauler There is a driver s side cupholder on the left side of the steering wheel  an odd feature that is actually quite sensible for 90  of us Another curious absence is any kind of lighted indicator on the dashboard to show what gear you are in  It s easy to go right past overdrive into 3l  so be careful when putting this car into gear  especially at night  The seats are comfortable initially  but quickly become uncomfortable  The lumbar support is thick  high and unadjustable  so unless you are the perfect height  forget about it  If you are considering this car be prepared to sit in it for at least a half hour before making any decisions Unfortunately  GM really dropped the ball on quality here  Their ads trumpet the Malibu s achievement in J D  Power s Quality surveys  But if you read the fine print  you see that they are talking about initial build quality  I can t complain about the build quality of the Malibu  It arrived fully functional and with no obvious rattles  loose screws or build flaws  Sure  the panel gaps are way wider than on a Toyota or Honda  but the car itself is well built The problem occurs when you actually drive the car  In just one year of ownership and driving less than 12k miles  I ve had to replace the radio  the AC unit  twice  and worst of all the front brake pads and rotors  twice    the latter not under warranty  After running very smoothly for the first month  the engine started getting rough  and fuel consumption has climbed dramatically  The dealership said there s nothing wrong with the car I ve asked lots of Malibu owners about their experiences  and I am not alone in having trouble with the Malibu  
 All I have to say is if your looking for a Truck the F150 would be a good choice  The F150 that I am telling you about is a 2000 F 150 4x4 Supercab Lariat 139 quot  WB flareside with a 5 4 EFI V8 engine  When I was out comparing trucks I was looking for one that had the power to pass at any given time and the comfort of a car  I compared price and that seemed about the same  The selling points for me was the look  the drive  and the power  This truck rides smooth and doesn t do bad on gas as well  As for the power  it was unmatched  Their are many different styles to choose from as well  Some other selling points would be the compartment between the seats has plenty of room for anything you might want to put in there  Although this truck is sleek  it probably would be a little difficult for some people to get in and out of it     
 Best thing about this van is the engine and ride   powerful engine  quiet good handling   I can forget I m in a big van and not a sporty sedan Next best thing is the power doors  I ve heard horror stories about them  but mine have been flawless  knock on wood  and it is awesome to be able to open the door with a remote and have it slide open when walking up with a load of groceries  I also like that the back seats fold completely out of sight  that is the main reason I chose the Odyssey over the Toyota Sienna because the Sienna doesn t  Worst thing is the seats   much less comfortable than my 92 Toyota Previa van  Front bucket seats feel hard and bench like  Why isn t leather available as option like all competing vans Also suprisingly bad front passenger legroom for a big van  I have a friend who is 6 0 quot  tall  and her knees barely fit in the passenger seat  Second worst thing is the anemic sound system No subwoofer  bad FM reception  radio has even less bass than CD player My old factory Toyota Previa system made the Honda system sound pathetic After I had the van a month I couldn t stand it and tore out the Honda system and put in a whole custom system with subwoofer  which was very expensive and hard to install because Honda did not design in a subwoofer locations  When we pulled out the factory speakers  we saw they were ultra cheap paper cone  lightweight magnet speakers like a car from the 60 s Only problem I have had is the SRS  air bag  light going on  Waiting for a part from the dealer on that Note  this van is BIG  Parallel parking spaces that I wouldn t think twice about pulling into in the Previa require careful alignment in the Odyssey br br  
 I purchased my 2001 bull in May of 2001 using the plethora of incentives then available  Mine is a Graphite Blue SES with Traction control  Heated mirrors  6 CD MACH audio system  5 pass  seating  Power Moon Roof  and base Vulcan engine The color can bug me  a 28 year old male  It can look purple under many light conditions and I hate purple  Too bad it didn t look that way at the dealership  Oh well  this is such a minor issue anyway The car is cheaper than many smaller offerings on the market with all of the constant incentives  You definitely get more than you pay for in a Taurus  My previous Taurus was a 1995 I traded in with 130 000 miles  It had only minimal problems  speedometer  oil pan gasket and water pump  with the latter waiting until around 120k I already have nearly 12 000 on this auto  It is relatively comfortable on long trips  Mind you it is no luxury model but it feels as nice as a Camry and almost as good as an Avalon  The trunk space is cavernous  2 FULL size suitcases  2 garment bags  1 toiletry bag and many Christmas gift bags fit with the seats in the normal position  Seats down  you can put small sheets of building materials  36x60 concrete board  for example  in there with the trunk closed  The passenger space is quite nice  Four large adults can fit very comfortably and five normal adults can ride with no complaints  It is also very easy to install child safety seats in this car I don t notice any transmission strain whatsoever towing my small sailboat to the lake  The engine tranny combo work nicely together for no questions asked acceleration  even up hills  Again  this is no  Vette but  it isn t your father s Oldsmobile  either  The down side of this is a lack of urban gas mileage  I get an average of 21mpg commuting  But once it is on the Interstate  mountain or coastal  it always tops 30mpg   HONEST I enjoy the robust MACH audio system  Especially with the choice to enjoy CDs  radio or tape  And I also realized last week in the snow how well the Traction control works  You barely have to know how to drive in inclement weather with this system on My only real beefs are that I can t control the compressor with a separate A C switch like the Camry has  had  It would be nice to turn off the A C for foot face vents or to turn it on for the foot only vent so the windows wouldn t fog up so easily  Oh well  this is almost as whiny as the color issue and the miscellaneous groans the car makes I had to get the Oil pan replaced at 9 000 miles  This is why I state possible quality issues  I don t like a car leaking oil at any mileage  especially this low  Lets hope it is only a fluke  
 I just love my SUV  WHy did we buy it  well my lease was up on my Honda and I wanted something that was big enough for the kids and all there stuff food shopping and just all the stuff that comes along with a family  We went to look at the ford and I feel in love with it as soon as I got behind the wheel and drove it  It drives great handles well for a SUV  What do I dislike about the ford  Hmmmmmmmm not sure I can come up with anything  OH yes the only thing I am not happy about it was recalled on two different times nothing major just small stuff Driving the Explore makes you feel safe  I like very much being up high and being able to see everything Who should buy this vehicle gt  anyone who wants to be safe  Families this is a great SUV for family  When my lease is up I will be getting a new one with out a doubt br br  
 If you re on a limited budget  you can t do much better than an older Mercedes Diesel  Mercedes are built to last  and even after 300 000  400 000  or more miles  the Diesels roll down the highway in style  For anywhere between  3 000 and  5 000  you can land one of these  quot autos quot   don t you dare call it a car  and if you re like me  you ll never go back to standard cars The Mercedes Diesels suit a particular type of driver  so take a moment to consider whether or not this is the right vehicle for you The Drive  Diesel engines are different from gas engines  Unlike gas engines  which use a spark plug to ignite the gas  diesel engines operate by compressing the fuel until it explodes without the aid of a spark plug  To handle this high pressure  diesel engines are far sturdier than gas engines  and they are also more fuel efficient  Here s what this translates to from a driver s perspective  diesel engines have very slow acceleration  but once they get moving  they cruise down the highway with the best of them  I often find myself sailing by newer compact cars or other gas cars that are spinning their engines to keep pace The older Diesels are heavy cars  which means that you have a sturdy and solid ride  Built before the days of aluminum and plastic  the Diesels rumble beneath you  and the bumpers can absorb just about any mid range impact without visible damage The Diesels drive like first class autos  with an oversized steering wheel and phenomenal cornering capabilities  The original brakes leave a little to be desired as compared to modern anti lock systems The Diesels also get great gas mileage  My 1981 240 model gets over 30 mpg on the highway  which is great considering the size of the car On a down side  the Diesels take time to wake up in the morning  Older models will often take a minute or two to warm up before you can start them  and then they can often sputter for the first minute of driving  Don t worry that it s something wrong with the car   it s just the way of the Diesel  Also  don t be alarmed by visible  and stinky  exhaust  You re driving a truck engine  and that s what Diesels do  California and other states offer grandfather clause exemptions to diesel vehicles for smog and emission requirements  Sorry  folks The Ride  You ll never escape the fact that these Mercedes are luxury cars  The style of luxury   leather interiors  walnut dash  and graceful curves   never seems to go out of fashion  which is part of the appeal of these classic autos  You can also sense that these cars were the top of the line when they were built  you ll hear a solid  quot whoomp quot  when you shut the door  and even the original floor carpeting is still plush  No sound from outside penetrates the cab of the Diesel  but you will find that the rumble of the engine throbs throughout your ride How to Shop  In addition to looking for proof of regular maintenance records  etc  you ll want to check the  quot engine compression quot  to determine the condition of your Diesel  As I mentioned before  diesel engines work by compressing the fuel until it explodes  It s critical  then  that your engine is tight and doesn t have any pressure leaks  If your engine compression is weak  you ll have trouble combusting the fuel and you ll have an inefficient and slow ride  In order to check your engine compression  you need to do the following  1  Take your Diesel to the top of a hill and aim down 2  Turn off the car but leave it in 4th gear 3  Release the brake  and parking break  and see what happens IF your Diesel remains stationary  held by the engine  then you re in good shape  But IF the Diesel begins to slip down the hill  you ve got poor engine compression and you ll need to reconsider the purchase I know it s easy to be skeptical of the Diesels   after all  why would anyone want a car that s over 20 years old  If I can t convince you  maybe everyone else in the Diesel club can   next time you re on the highway  keep your eyes open and you ll begin to see Diesel after Diesel cruising on its way br br  
 When I received my 1994 Pontiac Grand AM SE  I was thrilled  It had 17 000 miles on it  and I thought it was great  Little did I know what I was in store for  By the time I reached 40 000 I had already replaced most of my engine  The seats are uncomfortable and can only be bared for a few hours at a time  The angle of the seats make it hard for the driver to see the front of the car at times  and also make for a hard time while going in reverse  The shocks and struts were excellent until I reached 50 000 miles  Now the car feels as though it is going to fall apart at the slightest bump  Overall I recommend this car to no one  After driving this car for the past four years I am ready to sell it and get a nice foreign car  Although I have always been pro American cars  after this car  my mind has changed br br  
 I bought this V6 car a year old in 96 at 12K miles in Tallahassee  FL  I was told it was a lease  I think it was a rental as the remotes were still in the plastic  However  I read in Consumer Affairs that rentals were good buys  About a year later the AC went  under warranty so that saved me over  300 but still cost me a trip to the dealer  I also had problems with the radio  I also took it in 3 times to fix a rattle  which never was cured Right before my manufacturer s 3 yr 36K warranty was about to expire I noticed the white convertible top has started wearing  At first I thought it was just dirty  car was kept outside at the time  but when I realized it was wearing I brought it to the dealer and they replaced the top with no qualms  The new top was only exposed to being outside for a year and has spent the last 4 years in a garage and hasn t been wearing as bad  but it does have 2 small holes  not bad enough to leak Around 50K the torque converter HAD to be replaced which would have cost me    700 instead of  109 under extended warranty  The car now has 78K on it and no problems since  In fact  I just replaced the battery for the first time  Like any convertible it has a rattle  but just the one  The wind doesn t whistle through the top until you get up near 80 mph  The top is easy to put up   down  Rain does not get in  but watch out for the drive thru car wash  My Jag is the same way  so I guess it s a convertible thing  The ride is comfortable for a sports car  not hard  However  it doesn t hug the road either  The seats are VERY soft  like a sofa  I used to drive this car on 450 mile road trips 4 times a month with no problems  Gas mileage is about 28 29 HWY if you keep up with the maintenance The insurance is high because this car does not do well in accidents  The Trams Am is better in that area I have been shopping for a new car  I drove a Spyder  which handled nice  but very little room  and I 146m only 5 146 5 148   120  and almost no trunk or backseat  The Spyder  Sebring  Firebird   TransAm are overpriced comparatively to the Mustang  I get compliments on my car all the time and people can t believe it s 6 yrs old  I ve had 3 cars with T tops  after having a convertible I ll never go back to T tops  If you have been debating about getting a convertible  do it  Every free spirit should own one Update 2 02 Sold for  5500   89K   EVERYTHING still works   I got a ton of calls on this car  Bought a 97 Convt Jag  If I hadn t had the money for a Jag  I would have bought another Mustang Update 2 03   The new owner LOVES the car  
 What can you say  If you want a reliable car that gets good gas mileage  that is sporty looking and has room  then you want the 1999 Honda Accord  I personally own the 1998 Honda Accord LX and I love it  Guess what my previous car was  Yep you guessed in a 1991 Accord LX  Why the Accord  Well let s put it this way  I put 226 000  miles on my 1991 and made sure I kept it tuned and changed the fluids and I didn t start having trouble with it until the summer of 1998  It has never failed to start in any weather condition  The car has more than enough power to get you out of a situation or onto a freeway  Oh and for all you enviromentally concious folks out there  its smoke free   laughing  So for all you out there that need a car that will look good on you and work for you as well  its none other than the Honda Accord  Go get one  tell em  Section 31 sent ya br br  
 Mazda has got to be one of the best kept secrets in the automotive world  Mazda makes great cars  Sure they may be a little niche y but given the choice  I d rather have a Prot g  than a Civic  or a Millenia S rather than an Accord  And so it goes with the newest version of the tried and true Miata  given a choice between an Eclipse or a Miata   you guessed it   I ll take the Miata  The recent restyle of the Miata gave it a little more aggressive look   more like a real sports car  Critics mocked the early versions as looking too girly and cute  granted the first Miatas are cute  but the still have all the fun of an old MG  with the reliability of a Toyota The 2001 Miata is simply the best Miata yet  and that s how it should be  the newest version of a car should be the best  No one wants to repeat the near deadly blow given by Ford to the Mustang name when they introduced the Mustang II  Mazda knows what they have and they ain t going to fix it if it ain t broke On the road the Miata is noticeably stiffer  The Miata LS is 16  stiffer than last years model  and 22  more rigid  This may sound like a lot of jargon  but from behind the wheel  it is obvious what this all means   better handling and little or no cowl shake  The Miata has a go cart like feel when cornering  Turn in is quick and sharp  Obviously all this handling prowess comes at the expense of ride comfort  but it is tolerable  On twisty roads the new Miata feels as surefooted as other sports cars costing double the Miata s meek entry price of  21 000  The 5 speed is fun  and throws are short  Each gear virtually clicks into place   The 2001 Miata adds 15 hp over the 2000 model  making the total 155  155 hp in a car this size is plenty b  On the open highway  drop the shifter from 5th to 4th  squeeze the gas  and just try not to smile   you can t do it  Acceleration from a stand still is brisk  The new VVT system adds power  but it seems to come on all at once  Despite what the Mazda press release says  around town driving can be a little tedious  At about 3500 rpm  the Miata s 1 8L engine surges with what feels like turbo lag  even cars that are turbocharged deliver the power more smoothly than the Miata  However under anything but light acceleration  the Miata is pure fun  This is a true sports car   an Alfa Spyder or Fiat 124 for the 21st Century Inside  the Miata has a few shortcomings  One downside for this car is noise  even when the soft top is up  The top is very thin and plenty of wind and road noise find its way to your ears  opt for the removable hard top if this is to be your main mode of transportation  Once the top is down  and why wouldn t it be  a wind baffle helps to keep the cabin somewhat free from turbulent wind at the back of ones head  Also  a serious lack of storage space may have most women scratching their heads when trying to carry a normal sized purse  The best anyone can hope for is to store 5 or 6 CDs somewhere in the cabin    you ll get nothing and like it   10 minutes behind the wheel and you ll love it  The return of chrome ringed gauges add a classic touch to a car that is destined to be a true classic  The red  backlight dashboard is cool looking  without being gimmicky  Seats are more comfortable than Miatas of years past  Once a person is use to the sporty seating position  a trip of about 3 hours would be somewhat comfortable  but this is no Lexus  The usual switchgear is where it belongs  with the main complaint being the tiny heating and ventilation button  The circular fan switch is so small  a regular sized person must use only the thumb and 1st finger to adjust it  The stock stereo sounds better than average  but the display is sometimes hard to read  The center console has been redesigned  and now houses two cup holders  one driver complained that one cup holder was placed exactly where his elbow would normally rest  It s minor  but this car has gotten so good  the only complaints left are minor The Mazda Miata is about fun  It s not practical  and it doesn t isolate you from the road like a Toyota might  The 2001 Miata is probably the perfect 2nd car  For the price  only the VW GTI comes close to the Miata in the fun to drive factor  remember I said  for the price  but the GTI s top doesn t go down   that makes for an easy choice  Zoom Zoom indeed 155 hp was the published figure from Mazda  they have since said that the new figures were over stated by 8  this means the real horsepower should be more like 142 5 If you bought a 2001 Miata  Mazda wants to make it up to you by offering free scheduled maintenance and a  500 debit card to spend on whatever you want  Check with the dealer  they should know more  
 I bought this Contour SE because my old car died on me  The Ford company was advertising a sale  My husband and I looked around at all the cars on the lot  and we liked the Contour the best  We took a test drive  and we were sold  I like feeling safe while I m driving  It is a very dependable car  The interior is very comfortable  The seat fits me like a glove  The sound system is good  There are things that I dislike also  The cup holders are too far down for the driver to reach safely  The car has a distinct roaring sound while driving down the road  I wish that it came with a real spare tire  The car drives very well  All of the gauges are easy too see  If you are looking for a sporty car  this one is not for you  It makes a good family car br br  
 My wife uses this vehicle primarily as a minivan to haul our family and their stuff It holds everything with room to spare  even with the third row seat up  Every seat is comfortable with good legroom  headroom  shoulder room and hip room   even in the third row  Prior to this purchase  I was sold on Japanese vehicles  I was a little apprehensive about this Chevy  The Suburban now has 6000 miles on it  and  so far  I have no regrets  No problems yet It has a very nice  quiet ride  It is neither bouncy or harsh  It has a remarkable  car like ride  And  it has a very small turning radius in spite of its size  You CAN park it in a crowded lot  and on the first attempt  It also gets decent mileage   about 15 MPG in mixed driving  Better MPG than my old Toyota SUV that was half the size and only had a 6 cyl engine The fit and finish appear to be OK   better than my old GM products The only significant complaints I have are directed to the dashboard and center console  They are made of  cheap  plastic  The center console  for example  is hard as a rock with a nice ridge around its perimeter   it is not a friendly place to rest your arm during long trips  The radio is OK  but nothing to write home about The Suburban LT comes with front and side air bags  but no curtain air bags or vehicle skid control  which are available on many of its competitors  I also considered Toyota LandCruiser  too small  too expensive Toyota Sequoia  it came down to this or the Suburban  the Suburban won out because it was a little bigger  had more legroom and headroom in the 3d row  had much more storage room behind the 3d row  was thousands cheaper  had better visibility  but had the same turning radius  Lincoln Navigator  too small Ford Excursion  way too big  impossible to park  no visibility Update  Aug  2001  The Suburban now has 11 000 miles on it  We have had absolutely no problems with it  So far  so good  In fact  very good  My wife absolutely loves it Update  May 2003  The Suburban now has 33 000 miles on it  It is starting to show its first signs of what I consider GM trademarks  e g  some plastic trim pieces around the seats have fallen off  the electric driver seat is sporadic  the local dealer is bickering over fixing such things under warranty  or  with respect to the seat  he pretends he can t duplicate the problem when it is in the shop   despite being shown the problem when we drive in  Mechanically  however  we have had no problems  It is still a pleasure to drive and is still solid  At this point  I would not hesitate to buy another  Also  we had a ton of snow this past season  The auto 4 wheel drive feature worked flawlessly  
 Since purchasing a used Ford Ranger extended cab  95  model year  our lives have been seriously simplified  We have room for 4 passengers and the bed of course is great for hauling  The truck is reliable  dependable  zippy and never causes us any problems  It s not capable of hauling a large boat but since we don t own one  that s OK  Great for families who do lots of home remodeling and need to haul stuff from a lumber yard or for gardening mulch  etc We have also taken the truck for long road trips  8 hours or so  And keep in mind that is with 2 little kids and a 55 pound dog  The trip was great and the truck was plenty comfortable  Highly recommended and we are picky  picky  picky br br  
 I bought my  90 Maxima SE in  94 with over 88 000 miles on it  I still have it and my problems with it have been minimal  Now the car has over 135 000 miles on it and it s still running almost as well as it did 5 years ago  The car is classified as a sports sedan and I think I know why  The 6 cylinder engine does hog up more gas than other cars in its class  but the smooth ride is worth it  Since I bought it  I ve only had to change the timing belt  although that was preventative care  the battery  the brake pad linings  and the front headlight  In addition  the car seats are extremely comfortable  I ve spoken to other people who own Maximas and their problems were the same as mine  the bulbs in the headlights need to be changed at a faster rate than usual and the power windows begin to slow down  forcing me to manually pull up the window on the passenger side  Newer versions of the Maxima are even better  with more space in the interior and even smoother rides  The buying price is always reasonable and it always holds the road well  Definitely a great car to have br br  
 The opinion on 94 up Mustang is fairly uniform  WE LOVE em  I have owned 3 95 GT  then the 98 GT  now a 95 GT again  The only reason I sold the 98 was to go back to the 95 and the 5 0 engine  I think I will always have a mustang in the garage  For the money  get the convertible GT  Any how every one raves about Mustangs  let s talk about the down side  Insurance  whoa  it is high  it s like a car payment of it s own  MPG  17 25 I wish try  13 20 and if you drive hard it will be even less  Convertible Top  It almost never stretches  like some other cars  but the black is tough to keep black  you wash it and it is still grayish  and never use tire dressing  try seat conditioner  it will run oily residue all over the glass and paint  Leg Room  It is good up to about 5 10  tall in the front  then you may want to modify the seat position  easy job  visit mustangworld com  The back seats are good as long as the driver is short  but if the driver is tall  it will be tight  Trunk  It s OK  Interior  the shift position is fine  but could be placed better  The seat belts are good  but the plastic hooks that hold it out of the way at the shoulder don t perform well  neither do the ones at the base of the seat  by the door  The dash only comes in black  even if the seats are white  Engine  Big issue check the intake manifold  if it s plastic  it will be leaking now or soon  and it must be replaced with an all metal intake  The bright side  this is a great excuse to do a Hi Pro up grade  like the GT40 Intake  My fuel pump went out as well  Also  put in a K N air filter  and remove the air silencer  you ll pick up like 10hp  CHEAPLY  In fact there are many low cost  up grade parts for Mustangs  it s crazy Ok that s enough bad talk  I will leave you with this  Mustang is THE American roadster  It is hard to find any one who hates them  young  old  woman or man  This is great for resale  Another FACT  when you drive a Vette  or some exotic sports car  there are certain  ideas  people  women  get about what you may lacking   the car is making up for  Mustang is a hot car  but when you pull up in it  it s not like  Oh  he s trying to make up for something  when you pull up in your Mustang  it s more like  I can see me in That car  we must have some things in common  
 I recently came to the decision that I needed a new car well actually my old car decided to finally keel over and instead of dumping more money into the pit I went to the dealership Honestly I wasn t overly impressed with the design of the car  Don t get me wrong it s very cute but nothing special pops out until you add more money for a wing then it looks much cuter  I also opted for the EX model which comes with a sunroof and adds a little bit more charm With the EX model I also received a few extra items which made it even better  My car has a v tech engine  over head cam  nicer wheels  keyless entry  and a cd player  None of these options came with the lower models I have had the car for two months now and I am amazed at how much I enjoy driving it  I put gass in it less than once a week and drive a little over 300 miles on it with the AC on  Bumps in the road that my old car seemed to produce out of thin air have vanished  the AIr conditioner is extra great since my old car blew out hot air all of the time and the brakes could stop on a dime I really have to hand it to Honda  They make a very cute car for a very affordable price  With options it becomes even cuter and I m not embarassed to drive down the road in it  I can easily fit my friends or family in the back seat  it helps that they aren t very tall lol if I need too  And through Honda s financing I got a greta deal on financing at 4 99  which is wonderful since I m still a college student with not a whole lot of credit established  
 I bought my 1996 Neon Sport brand new my first new car  in fact  I didn t want to spend much money  and this was the cheapest Chrysler product I could find  gotta go where you get the family discount  right I decided on a black 4 door DOHC with a manual transmission  and the upgraded engine  150 bhp  I m really glad I got the manual it s not a very quick little car  but it seems  and sounds  a lot quicker with a stick shift I ve owned this car for just over 3 years now  and have put nearly 90 000 miles on it  The only problem I ve had occurred recently my  quot check engine quot  light came on  A quick check showed the problem to be related to the EGR valve  Fascinating After doing a bit of research  both on and off the Internet  I found out what an EGR valve is and what it does  The problem could have been one of three parts  my husband and I decided to replace all three  about  90  Still much cheaper than taking it to a dealership or other shop to figure out which part s  had gone bad  and then letting them fit it Anyway  other than this minor glitch  it s been a good car  The gas mileage is great at least 30 miles to the gallon  I do a lot of highway driving  It handles well  and is pretty comfortable However  it s definitely showing it s age feels like it s not driving quite as smoothly as it used to  and when I first start it up  there s an odd noise coming from the engine  as if I were low on oil  even when I m not  Although I was recently told at the oil change place that I have a small oil leak And come to think of it  I ve noticed some vibration in the steering wheel  especially at highway speeds  Even after replacing the tires and checking the front end alignment  Curious So in conclusion  I d have to say that the Neon is a great inexpensive car  but not a good idea if you plan to keep it more than about 75k miles This just in If you d like a professional review of the  96 Neon  check out this site at carclub com http www carclub com cgi bin buyerconnection vehicle reviews pl car id 1952   
 I recently purchased a 1997 Dodge Intrepid Sport and I must say  this vehicle is quite impressive  Whether you are in the market for a family sedan or are single and have moved beyond your obsession with two seater sports cars and want something more practical this car is for you The first thing that is appealing about the Intrepid is it s sophisticated yet sporty appearance  Unlike other 4 door vehicles  such as the Lumina or Park Avenue  the Intrepid is very sleek and manages to remain stylish while still being considered as a  quot family sedan quot  This results in savings of hundreds of dollars a year on auto insurance At the time I purchased my Intrepid  I also test drove a 1998 Nissan 240sx and a 1998 Acura Integra  Amazingly  their on road performance was not significantly superior to the Intrepid  With a 3 5 liter V6 engine  the Intrepid provides surprising power and acceleration  It handles extremely well  even at high speeds and is whisper quiet  Have you ever driven a vehicle that suffers serious power lag from doing something as simple as turning on the Air Conditioner  You won t have that problem with the Intrepid Other appealing features of the 1997 Intrepid are the Dual Air Bags and Anti lock breaks which come as standard equipment  Both of these safety features provide you with peace of mind  especially if your teens may be driving the vehicle The Interior is both roomy and stylish highlighted by a contemporary dash display and selectively placed air vents  The side air vents on the intrepid are actually in a rounded section of the driver and passenger side doors  This may seem like a small item to make note of  but it allows for adequate cooling of the car without having the AC running on full strength   a option which will save both power and gas The trunk is also nicely sized   providing more than enough height to get the groceries in the trunk without smashing the bread or potato chips  The spare tire is stored in a recessed area and is never in your way  yet is easily accessible in the event you need it The Intrepid is a high quality vehicle  perfect for nearly anyone   like I said  whether you have a family or are single and looking to graduate to a more  quot grown up car quot  the Intrepid is for you  It s sporty good looks  contemporary styling and practicality can t be beat     
  I THOUGHT I WANTED A FORD ESCAPE  Being somewhat of an environmentalist it was important for me to purchase a vehicle that got good gas mileage  As such  I went to the dealership thinking the new Ford Escape would be just the ticket  However  when I sat inside and felt the limited padding and rather cheapish materials I knew I just couldn t live with it  Then I spied it across the lot  the new Explorer Sport Trac  It was like no vehicle I had ever seen  Was it an SUV or a truck I didn t care  Once I sat in it I was hooked and all thoughts of good gas mileage somehow dropped from my priority list b EXTERIOR  10  For me  the exterior rates a clear ten  It is truly innovative  Not just a truck with four doors and not just a SUV with a glued on bed  Nope  This puppy was REALLY well thought out  I love how the four doors mold in an elliptic form  how it utilizes curves and angles  Very sexy  I also love how the bed is likewise curved and raised  And who thought of the recycled  nearly bullet and scratch proof bed  I also like the tonneau cover  although a bit pricey it is absolutely fantastic  Unlike traditional tonneau s this one hinges in the middle  can be locked tight  is easily lifted on or off with just one person  without need of steroids  and is strong enough to jump on  It s like having a bed and a huge watertight trunk at the same time b INTERIOR  10  The interior I also rated a ten  It too is truly innovative  My favs are the stylish use of upholstery materials  Very handsome and a great alternative for those of us that are opposed to leather  The white faced instruments are also appealing without being garish  The softpak removable storage holder  berber on rubber floor mats and rear electric window are nifty beyond compare  The CD player offers good but not great sound  not bad for standard fare  And the seats are well  I could live in them  I also like how the rear seats fold down nearly flat but still are fairly plush  And this rig truly seats five people  with legroom to spare b RIDE   HANDLING  7  Prior to the Sport Trac I owned a truck  so I m used to a fairly stiff ride  All things considered the ride and handling rate about a seven  It is certainly comfy  a far more plush and quiet ride than my old Ford Ranger  Even my Grandmother gave it two thumbs up  Still  when pushed hard in corners it shows nearly all of it s two ton plus weight  keeling over more than I prefer  I also have minor complaints regarding slight wind road noise at speeds over 60mph and some minor rattles coming from within the dash area  And the Firestone tires I can t wait to buy another brand b ENGINE  8  The 4 0L V6 runs well and has plenty of power  Again  not being a car enthusiast I m happy with anything that does 0 60 in less than a minute  so 8 8 seconds is pretty good in my book  I even burned a little rubber at the grocery store  must have been reminiscing about my younger years  The gas mileage is  however  a shocker to me  I know all you Jeep Grand Cherokee owners are used to it  but 15mpg in pure city driving and 20mpg on the highway is something I m just not used to  One consolation  I was pleased the Sport Trac is rated LEV  low emission vehicle so I guess my sense of environmentalism is still marginally intact b FIT   FINISH  8  Overall I m pleased with the fit and finish of the Sport Trac  Most things fit well and are well manufactured  The door shut very solidly  unlike the Ford Escape  the tailgate works smoothly and the body panels inside and out are  for the most part  well fitted  Of course once one buys a new vehicle there is always room for improvement  unless it s a Lexus  For example  my hood needed repainting due to an obvious factory blemish  The gas door was not aligned perfectly  causing it to rub the paint when opening and closing  And I had some squeaks and clicks coming from the front suspension going over small bumps in the road b VALUE  10  Dang  I got such a GREAT price on this vehicle that I can t help but rate it a ten  The sticker price was over  28 000  not counting dealer markup which made it even higher  but I picked it up for a tad over  23 000  Even without the great price it is still a great value  Name another vehicle that you can take five people up skiing without being cramped  carry muddy mountain bikes along dusty trails  haul gravel without scratching the bed  roll down the back window to scruff your dog s head  actually my dog sits inside  and still turn heads when you drive in downtown traffic b SUMMARY  After three months of ownership the Explorer Sport Trac is everything I hoped it would be excluding the mileage thing  It s Awesome Dawson  a Great Mate  Super Duper  Free   Easy and as FUN  FUN  FUN as it gets  
 In 1997  Toyota released the redesigned Camry in the United States  The new model was very similar to the old  but there were a few distinct differences that completely changed the personality of the car  Basically  it erased what little there was My step mother owned a 5 speed  87 Camry and she absolutely loved it  When it was time for a new car  the obvious choice for her was the new Camry  She purchased a lightly equipped LE model  It was not long before she missed her old Camry The  97 Camry is a very easy and comfortable car to drive  The controls are all placed logically and the displays are all very clear and well positioned  The seats are comfortable enough and there is plenty of space  even in back  The car is also very reliable  There is also practically no engine or wind noise inside the cabin  The gas mileage is good and the snow traction is more than adequate for suburban Boston winters  However  not everything about the car is ideal Changes between this generation  97 and the previous  92 96  include adjustment to the suspension  My step mother describes the handling as being like  driving a limo  My mother s  94 Camry handles better on city streets than any car I have driven to date  The steering gives a very large level of control and enough road feel to inspire confidence in tight maneuvers  In an effort to provide a more comfortable and  refined  ride  the  97 Camry has a less tight suspension  As a result there is more body roll and the handling  while still better than most cars  is less appealing  The steering is a bit too heavy and the brake pedals also require just a little bit too much force The largest disparity between the  97 and the previous model comes as a result of 100 pounds of extra weight  This extra weight makes a difference in terms of power since 130hp does not provide much surplus  There may not be a significant difference in acceleration between the two models  but the newer Camry just feels slower  These few problems with the Camry provide a boring ride The  97 Toyota Camry is a very nice car for everyday use and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for good reliable basic transportation  The looks are not great but not bad either  The handling is subdued but far from bad  Practically everything about the car is nice  but nothing is outstanding  Nothing is  fun  
 We bought our Ford Explorer XLT after we found out we were expecting our second child  During the selection process  we discovered the Explorer to be a roomier  more reasonably priced SUV than some of the major competition With two small children who still ride in carseats  we needed more room than what we could get with the average size family car  We also needed storage for a double stroller  diaper bags  toys  and groceries  etc  Living in Missouri during the long winter months also provided a need for the 4WD feature  After test driving several sport utility vehicles and mini vans  this Explorer was the best option for us  Compared to the other similar sport utility vehicles  there was far more storage space due to the fact that the spare tire rides underneath the vehicle  Also  there was tons more head room and passenger room in the front  The separate heat cooling options for the back make our children more comfortable as well  The 4wd is super easy to use  and we have used it a lot during the winter months  The one major drawback to this particular vehicle is it rides a bit rougher than the other sport utilities that we tested  The ride is more like a truck than a passenger car  but the roomier seating  head room  and storage more than make up for this disadvantage br br  
 The 1996 Honda Accord has a few noticeable differences from its 94 95 siblings  Chrome accents have been added  the tail lights have become more conservative  and the wheels have gotten bigger on the LX  15 quot  With that said  this is still your basic family sedan The Accord consistently receives high marks each year  and this model is no exception  It is arguably the most dependable car for under  20k  I own a  96 LX sedan  and it now has 128 000 miles  Yeah  that s a lot  But my previous Accord lasted way beyond that  so I expect to see this baby all the way into the 200 300k What does it have  Dual airbags  ski hole in the back seat  great engine  power everything  and a high build quality   something I can t really explain  stuff like all the moldings snap on tight and seem to be secure  Oh  and dual stage locks  one of those quirks you find after owning it for years  explanation  use the key to unlock driver s door  but if you hold it for 2 seconds  it unlocks all doors What does it lack  Well  I have a few grievances with my Accord  Firstly  I think this generation  5th  and the previous generation have faulty glove box locks  The light inside will turn on sometimes when I go over a bump at night  which I blame on the sensor not lining up correctly  The other complaint is the transmission  which Honda fixed in the 98  models  It gives a little kick before changing gears  The wind noise  tire noise  is tolerable  I wouldn t say it is quiet  but it won t annoy you either  And being a Honda  the torque is lacking   even though the Accord is better than a Civic in this department To sum things up  this is your standard Honda  All the controls are where you would think them to be  reliable beyond all hopes  good gas mileage  lots of extras  and a reasonable price tag  I would recommend this car for a teenager s first car or for someone who doesn t want to worry about maintenance problems  It ll get you from point A to B with a good bit of comfort  and you don t have to worry about it dying on you br br  
 I looked at a few other vehicles before purchasing my 2003 Forester XS  I was in the market for a smaller SUV or Wagon that would hold a fair amount of stuff for weekend trips to Home Depot and the like  Every vehical I looked at had some form of 4 wheel drive   read articles on Edmunds com that describe different 4 wheel drive systems All Subarus are All wheel drive   AWD  This feature is on all the time and does not require manually engaging when the weather turns bad  Here is a quick synopsis of the comparable vehicles that I test drove Hyundai Santa Fe Nice looking vehicle but had very poor acceleration Mitsubishi Outlander Also nice but read reviews about lack of power and didn t pursue test drive Ford Escape Nice   ride was very smooth but definately more truck like  Rear was wide enough to hold a 4X8 sheet of dimensional lumber  The Escape was my second choice Mazda Tribute Built on same platform as Ford Escape so main difference was in trim appearance  Had a bizzare quirk in that you had to send the brake pedal almost to the floor before it engaged  This was enough for me to place this after the Escape Now for the Forester Looks   somewhat non descript but I see that as plus as it won t look dated in a couple of years  My Forester is Silver which looks great but I would also consider the Black Mica which is black with gold flecks in the paint which gives it a different hue depending on the lighting  Chrome wheels and raised white letters on tires look a bit racey for this kind of vehicle Drive  Rides pretty much like a compact car  You do sit up a bit higher than a car but the Forester never feels  tippy The seat adjustment has a wide up and down range which allows you to select the right feel for you  Visibility is very good all around  Forester handles very smoothly on most roads but deeply rutted roads will knock you around a bit  Forester has the best headlights I ve ever owned on a car which is big plus for you if you live in a heavily deer populated area like I do  The XS package comes with foglights which do lay out a noticable blanket of light directly in front of the vehicle  Radio on same package includes a 6 CD changer and overall sounds very good for a stock sound system  Also standard on XS are heated seats which work very well Amenities Rear seats fold down in a snap and you have a nice bed for lots of cargo  Get the cargo tray option which is a rubberized insert for the rear cargo area  Makes cleanup a snap after hauling a messy load  Lots of other little storage compartments all of the car Purchase Subaru has a nice website that provides links to all dealers in your area  You can view each dealer s inventory with detail on options and pricing  I found most dealers willing to sell at  200  500 over dealer invoice  After I did my test drives it was just a matter of surfing the web until I found the exact vehicle   colors and options  The dealer I called gave me the price over the phone and we closed the deal on the spot In summary I thought the Forester had the best combination of value  quality  comfort and saftey features   Forester is top ranked in crash tests  AWD is standard as well as front and side airbags  In my opinion you can t go wrong with this vehicle  
 I had a 93 Escort up until today  I was in a very horrible accident today and my Escort saved my life  I called her Suzie  She was white and had attitude  Now she has gone to the salvage yard in the sky  A larger vehicle hit me and the interior of the car held up wonderfully  Both cars were totaled  I will be buying another Escort to replace my old one  I had her 7 years and the only thing I ever did to her was scheduled oil changes and such  The mass air flow sensory went out one time and had to replace  that it was  79 00  That was the only repair in 7 years  I will miss her br br  
 Just recently my fiance and I bought a 1997 Ford Expedition  We love it  It has so much room  It is great for road trips  You will never have to worry about your knees getting smashed or elbows being bumped again  We have a 7 month old daughter  and we can log all of her stuff around with us  It is dependable  We haven t had any problems with it  Anyone with a family should own one of these  It makes going anywhere just that much easier  I know that they are costly  but it is worth it  I know that a lot of people don t have high expectations of FORDS   my fiance USED to be on of them  but this vehicle could change your mind  It handles very well in all weather conditions  So you won t be afraid to go out in bad weather  My overall view of this vehicle is excellent br br  
 I am the somewhat satisfied owner of a 1988 Toyota Camry  I initially bought the car because I heard that Camrys are good cars  However  my Camry is not all that impressive  It may be a great car compared to other 1988 4 cylinder compacts  but for today s standards  it s not at all impressive  Where should I start  Well  the engine is just too small of an engine for this car  My Camry has the 2 0L 4 cylinder engine  The engine surges and strains trying to get up hills  mainly when accelerating  This engine is easily slowed down by adding ANY passengers  I have had to take my Camry to the shop three times within a year to get numerous oil leaks fixed  Oh yeah  IT STILL LEAKS OIL  On the other hand  the engine is very smooth running  Except at idle  when it vibrates annoyingly like one of those cheap motel beds  The transmission is the only good mechanical part of this car  The 4 speed overdrive automatic transmission is smooth shifting into all gears  Surprisingly  flooring the throttle at 70mph to pass causes the transmission to downshift into third gear  I think you can imagine what it s like driving at 70mph in third gear  It s not all that quiet or comforting to hear the engine buzzing at 5 000rpm at 70mph  This is the only car I ve ever driven that downshifts to pass going 70mph  The seats up front are kind of comfortable  except for that there is NO BACK SUPPORT  My Camry has no lumbar support and all who ride up front suffer  I can t drive it for much more than a half hour before my back cramps up  The seats in back are at a good position  but are too firm for long trips  The suspension gives a very soft  comfortable ride  However  in emergency handling  the car leans and wobbles all over the place  It s kind of weird  but the steering wheel is too big and the steering is very loose  making it a bit hard to steer  especially when driving in a parking lot  Oddly enough  the insurance for my Camry cost more than for a newer Volvo Turbo sedan  So far  my Camry has 135 000 miles on it  I could probably put another 100 000 miles on it  but I don t think it s a car worth keeping  Please  don t make the same mistake I did  I think I ll buy an Accord next time or at least a 1992 or newer Camry     
 This car is quite a step up from my previous tin can  a  Toyota Tercel  The Golf is quiet  fun to drive  and the stereo system is great  Remote control locks seem like an annoying affectation when other people use them  but now I wonder how I lived without beeping the car locked from ten feet away  and beeping it again  just to make sure and again and The two door has an ingenious little seat popping device that allows the seat to pop completely up  allowing you to extricate annoying back seat passengers in seconds  Even my parents managed to climb out of the back seat quickly  and it takes them years to do anything  This is a nice little car  probably the best nice little car  It s easy to park  despite being much wider than most compacts  The design is nice  despite the gimmicky cupholder  which is square and requires at least two hands to use  and which makes it impossible to put CDs in  The car is spacious  and you ll need a passenger to hold your soda Other small grumble  this car has a huge blind spot  and part of the seat back  the middle part  makes little squeaking noises and feels like it s stuffed with cheap newspaper   You d think for all the money they spent doing market research to decide that the car needed to look more opulent  they could ve designed a better seat  Also  we wanted cruise control  but it wasn t available in a two door  
 The 3 5RL  Acura s flagship sedan is a practical sedan comparable to such luxurious vehicles as the LS400 and the E class Mercedes Benz  The RL has been called a  quot poor man s lexus quot  by so many because of the lower cost of this car but similar style of automobile First I would like to explain my background and familiarity with the Acura 3 5RL  My family has been a fan of Acura for many years  We first owned an Acura Legend for 5 years which was passed from my mother to my brother when he turned 16  After the Legend was discontinued by Acura  my parents got a 3 2RL  Furthermore  my parents would own 2 other 3 5RL s after the 3 2RL  As you can see  I have experienced several Acura sedans  so I have definite exposure to the vehicle discussed here b Performance  This vehicle comes with a powerful 3 5 liter V6 engine  210 horses power the RL and make for some decent acceleration  This is a large car at about 3700 pounds  so the acceleration will not overpower you  I have found that when already moving  if you put the pedal down  the car has a rather long pause before the car kicks back and goes  However  for the average driver  the engine should be sufficient  In comparing the RL to most Lexus and Mercedes sedans  there is an obvious gap in performance considering most of those vehicles pack a V8 b Suspension and handling  The 2000 model has a new handling system called Vehicle Stability Assist  This system has traction control and an outstanding anti lock braking system which will keep this car under control in shaky conditions  Personally  I have had some fun with this car taking corners and driving around curves at higher speeds  The handling is pretty good  but note that it is obviously not going to be as good as Mercedes  Lexus  and BMW  Overall  the RL is easy to control and provides a great smooth  comfortable ride b Interior  The interior of the RL is spectacular  Leather seats with power controls give great comfort to the driver and his her passengers  A 7 inch DVD navigation screen is an option on the 2000 RL  There is more than ample leg room for front and rear passengers  The Bose stereo upgrade is definitely a good buy which provides a ear pleasing sound b Exterior  The exterior of the RL is very professional as well as slightly sporty  The front of this car  in my opinion  rivals that of many of the other popular luxury sedans  The car comes with 16 inch wheels that provide a nice appearance  For those interested in purchasing this car  I suggest the black exterior color b Reliability  With both 3 5RL s which my family has owned  we have had very little problems with them  The cars have never broken down  and have only needed the regular maintenance which comes with owning ANY automobile  The Acura dealership where I live has been extremely helpful should any problem arise  The RL is a 10 out of 10 on the reliability scale b Conclusion  The price of the 3 5RL is from  42 000 to  45 000  This is a very practical and economical price for those looking for a professional  luxurious  roomy sedan  When compared to 4 door sedans from BMW  Lexus  and Mercedes  the cost is significantly cheaper  For those looking for a sedan in the price range of the RL  check out the Lincoln LS  My family and I have thoroughly enjoyed driving the RL  which is obvious since we have owned several  If you are looking for a luxurious sedan that is less expensive than most Mercedes and Lexus sedans  I highly recommend you check out the Poor Man s Lexus  the Acura 3 5RL br br  
 After pouring way to much money in my 88 Thunderbird Turbocoupe  which was overall a good car suffering from old age and high mileage  it was time to purchase a new vehicle My criteria for purchasing a new car were simple 1  4 cylinder turbocharged or supercharged engine 2  170 225 hp 3  Manual Transmition 4  Excellent Handling 5  Under  25 000 6  Rear wheel or four wheel drive 7  Or it had to be a BMW Not too many cars fit it the top six anymore  The only turbo super charged cars on the market at the moment  are the Subaru WRX  Mercedes C230  Dodge Neon R T  or a Saab  just to name a few  I really liked the Subaru WRX  which was running at the top of my list  but the new design is a little on the funky side with the round headlights  Certainly could go for the previous model  but the new model was new  had excellent handling  very good power  and was a manual  The Mercedes was up there also  but with all the desirable options  it ran well over  30 000  Though I loved the interior design  the rear end of the car  from the side  looked like someone chopped of the back of a regular Mercedes  Dodge Neon R T was just too small and had not hit show rooms yet  And I have seen too many of them flipped on their roof along the highway  Among other notables  Toyota Corolla S  Excellent looking car  great price no power whatsoever  Toyota Solaria Convertible  Great looking car  reliable way to expensive for a Toyota  Though there are others that made my list based on just plain being a nice car  for one reason or another  they got dismissed rather quickly  usually due to reliability issues  The finally criteria was they had to be from a reputable dealer with either the remaining factory warranty or certified pre owned  All these criteria so many cars who made the pick  BMW what else Most of my family owns BMW s  Father has a 95 318ti  mother has 84 320i  Brother has 89 525i  Uncle has a 99 540i  and cousin has a 99 M Roadster  So needless to say  I 146m very familiar with BMW s  I know all the models  all the engines  all the features  and in general a BMW nut that never owned one  but really wants an 8 series never happen mostly due to price  Though at first when I was looking at a new car  I dismissed getting one  probably due to the price of the brand new ones  relatively high price of the used ones  and the so called high maintenance costs associated with these cars in general Almost by accident  I ran into a local used car dealer where he had a 95 325i convertible  all black  fully loaded  and under  15 000  Almost bought it  until I tried to open the trunk  and it wouldn t open  with the line from the salesman that there was a trick to opening it  There is a trick to opening it  you hit the button and they lift right up  This wouldn t open at all  In conjunction with the dozen warning lights  from the on board computer about the rear tail lights  missing deck emblem  and other little quirks  I concluded that the car was rear ended and a Car Fax report confirmed that  But driving the car yielded no issues other than pure fun  especially with the top down  So this car got me looking at more BMW s at a reputable dealer After hitting Thompson BMW in Doylestown  PA one of the largest and best dealerships in the area by reputation  I went straight to the older used ones  with hopes of getting one for under  15 000 what I thought I wanted to spend on a BMW  This put me in the 89 to 95 year models  Being with my brother  accidentally ended up in the newer used certified pre owned section of the lot  This one car caught my eye immediately  jet black 323 is  I automatically dismissed this car as being to expensive  without even asking the salesman what it cost  Being that the larger dealerships tend to not have too many older used cars on the lot  nothing really qualified to my criteria  as most were automatics  came with the standard 90 to 6 months used car warranty  and were not in the best of condition  I went back that same night with my brother after the dealership closed to look around again  again the black 323is stood out in a lot of newer and expensive 3  5  Z series cars  Again dismissed as too expensive  never really gave it a second thought  The next weekend  I hit the same dealership with my brother to see if anything new had arrived  Nothing worth mentioning but the 99 Jet Black 323is was still there  my brother being a BMW nut  convinced me to take it for a test drive because he wanted to see what a newer E36 3 series was like  I never cared for the E36 body style as I thought they were too boxy  to plain looking  But this car has something different about it  It looked lower  longer  had all the ground effects  including front lip spoilers  side moldings  and nice rims with wide tires  Again  not being interested in spending  30 000 for a car  I had no real intentions other than to see what a newer car was like to drive  So the salesman let us take it out for a test drive  I was amazed to say the least  Very quick car for a 2 5 liter car had excellent handling  and a nice shifter feel with a softer but still hard compared to the average BMW clutch  The interior was beautiful all black leather  all the comforts except power seats  and a nice steering wheel with an  M  emblem on it as well as the shifter  So I got my brother to drive it and he was in love also  Up to this point  I still had no idea what the car cost  Once we got back the salesman quickly took us inside  As much as I know about BMW  I never really heard of the 323 series  with the exception of the classic car of days gone by  TO my knowledge the 3 series consisted of the 318  325  328  and M cars  Once inside at the salesman s desk  he quickly quoted a price of  30 500  I laughed in his face  Seeing my reaction  I got the usual lets make a deal  Before I knew it  we were talking in the range of  26 700  Now I know this is typical of how dealerships markup there prices  Well  that price was fairly reasonable for the car and just slightly higher than the  book  value  The run down  1999  323is  with 33 000 miles on the odometer  sport and premium package  jet black with  M  exterior package  Racing Dynamics front lip spoiler  leather heated seats   M  interior package  on board computer  power everything except for the seats  sunroof  fog lights  leather arm rest and so on  Very nice car  After talking the typical financing stuff  I decided to think about it  And wished the guy a goodnight  On the way home  I surely had a smile on my face  I was more than impressed with the car itself  Was it going to be my next new car  After doing my typical research of the model  being that I really didn t know much about the 98 99 323is  I found out some interesting things about it  For starters  this car was going to be the replacement for the 318  as BMW s new policy of no more 4 cylinder cars  My father owns a 318  and quite frankly  how the 323 can be remotely considered a replacement is laughable because it is a far superior car  Next though its displacement is a 2 5 liter  BMW wanted to distinguish the car from the previous 325  but renumbering its designation to 323  Next  even though the displacement would indicate that it would have the basic 2 5 liter engine  it in fact is a modified 2 8 liter  sharing most of the engine s components with a modified head  The fuel system management system  usually designed by Bosh  for most of the BMW line  is in fact designed by Seemans  What all this means for the average person  Probably nothing at all  Just interesting facts I guess  But what most people will notice when they first drive the car is the throttle response  likely due to the revamped fuel management system  the use of double variable valve timing  and OBD II engine computer program system  Being that this car was only manufactured for 2 years makes it somewhat special  The fact that it was also manufactured at the end of the E36 model run  traditionally will make the car one of the most reliable of the model series  as BMW has worked out most of the kinks  The particular model I was interested in  had the Optional Sport Package  consisting of the more obvious   M  Trim inside such as the sport steering wheel   M  striped shifter  on the outside  sport alloy wheels with ZR rated tires  and to top if off  a sport tuned suspension  which makes this car kick butt in the turns  A car without the sport package  though respectable  didn 146t have the fun factor or visual appeal of those that do  Next it has the premium package  which includes to the best of my recollection  fog lights  leather seats  power sunroof  leather arm rest  onboard computer  and leather seats  the later two  I 146m not sure if these were actually part of the package or just add options  Also on the car  dual electronic climate control  security keyless entry system  tape deck  dual airbags  with side impact bags  All BMW models of the later years have hook up for CD player and car phone  The interior overall is a very nice place to be  The front seats are cozy and firm enough to provide good support on long trips  Seats have nice adjustable headrests  including the back seats  Will seat 5  however for a typical coupe  though roomy in the back  maneuvering to get back there requires a little dance of tuck  turn  twist and sit  But after all it is a coupe  Dashboard layout is nice  very nice  All controls are where they should be  and easy to reach  The steering wheel is just a few inches away from the dash  and is not adjustable which is a little different  but the view of the instrument panel is never obstructed  The center console  though a little cluttered  is overall very nicely layed out and makes a nice light show in the dark  In the shifter area  there are the controls for the windows  heated seats  Active Stability Control  and a little light that shows everyone that the car s security system is armed  Front seats for some reason are not powered  a little annoying considering what the car costs  Rear seats fold down giving you some nice area for storage from the trunk  Behind the front seats are net map holders  which look really nice  Doors have two compartments for storage  but overall there is not much storage but then again it 146s not a mini van  All seats have 3 point seatbelts  Onboard computer gives all the driving essential information  fuel range  mileage  outside temperature  check control  timer  and alarm settings  all accessible either from the unit or the turn signal lever The doors have a trick to them  where since there is no actual frame around the window  open you open the door handle the window will come down a quarter of an inch to clear all the rubber molding around the door  A feature only the older 8 series has  When you climb in and shut the door  back up it goes  creating a perfect seal  All the windows have 1 touch up or down  if you press the button all the way down  Also there is a one touch door lock button  probably more useful for the four door and lock all doors  including trunk and fuel door  Heated seats have two levels  put it on high  when they are nice and warm  they automatically switch to the lower level  Personally I think they take a while to warm up  Dual climate control perfect  air conditioning blows like an icebox  the heater is going in almost 2 minutes of driving  when set to 90  You can adjust where you want the hot air to blow when on the automatic setting with a little turn wheel next to the vent  Cruise control system on BMW s is nothing like you ll find on an American car  different place  different operation  but has been used by BMW for over 15 years  Just a matter of getting used to it  Sunroof is powered  either pops the rear up or retracts all together  Personally I prefer a moon roof  When open under deceleration there is some wind buffeting in the cabin  but remains quite the rest of the time  Note  do not run the windshield washer with the windows open  You will get fluid in the car  Obviously there is no rail on the roof to redirect water and fluid over the car  The floor mats lock in place by means of a Velcro pad  and never move an inch  Trunk and hood are all hydraulically held in place  The trunk though roomy has the rear window in the way  preventing getting larger objects in the car easily  In the trunk  the full size spare  actual alloy wheel  the same that are on the car  is under a nice trunk mat with rubber straps to prevent objects from sliding around  Overall very nice trunk  The control check monitors all head and taillights  turn signals  fluid levels  to name a few and tells you when there is a problem and where to look to fix the problem  The onboard computer in the dash tell you when to service the car and chance the oil based on how you drive  how far you drive  or on a time interval  Since BMW uses high end synthetic oils  oil change intervals are 12 000 to 15 00 miles  It lets you know just in case you forget anyway  Service intervals are in relatively long intervals  but cost a nice chunk of change  But all is taken care of  and when the recommended maintenance  these cars last forever  It 146s not uncommon for them to last 200 000 miles plus  But the premium is not cheap when repairs are required outside of warranty So how does it drive  Like it 146s on rails  Its that good  The handling on the car is awesome  A combination of all the goodies from the sport suspension  to the all season traction control  active stability control  anti lock brakes  50 50 weight ratio  and Z rated tires  the car will enter any turn at any speed and stick like it is a true sports car  The engine has a silky smooth feel to it  It s idle is always constant and very smooth  Put it into first gear  depress the rather soft clutch  and the car launches off  hitting red lines rather quickly and aggressively  In between shifts  The RPMs don 146t drop very much  making the shift to second very easy  Here the power curve of the car becomes noticeable  From idle the RPMs rise nicely as to never upset the car or scare the driver  Once on the way at around 3 000 RPMs  the car takes off hitting a jump in the power curve  launching it away at a nice pace  Once again around 5 000 RPMs the it happens again  all the way up to redline and repeat it all over again in the next shift  This thing could haul way past 150 if not for the governor  At any speed  this car is quite  no wind noise  and always handles what it is given and then some  Should you make an unlikely mistake  the active stability control steps in and modulates the engine power  and I think the brakes  to get you back under control  With the system off  get ready to smoke those Z rated tires on demand  The traction on the car though is awesome up until you hit some snow  regardless of the amount  Even with the all season traction control  with the sport tires  this car is worthless in the snow  Almost impossible to get it going once you do though if you do it can handle it  But the car stinks in the snow with those tires  Period  With snow or all season tires then its one of the best cars in the white gunk for a rear wheel drive car  But at what they cost from BMW forget it  Have a second car handy for the winter  Now the negatives of the car though there are few  Mentioned earlier  the windsheild wiper fluid enters the car if the windows are open  The pedals of the car are made of less than adequate material the clutch pedal actually squeaks  nothing that could not be fixed with aftermarket pedals I guess  but for a BMW  hardly acceptable  Some of the interior panels on the lower dash are not of the greatest material either  but are visually pleasing  Under the hood  there is no light  but I guess that 146s what the rechargeable flashlight in the glove box is for  Plug it in and it is always there when needed  Even after all this I was a little hesitant to buy the car  especially since the new E46 model 4 door came out the same year  After test driving them  I wasn t that impressed  even though I think it is a much better looking  bigger  and more modern looking car  Test drove an M Roadster also  but with two seats  for a primary car didn t work either  Plus with the top up it 146s rather tight  Hit my head on the roof rails several times  and that took that car out of the equation  But driving it was a blast So needless to say I bought the car for  26 000  which required some wheeling and dealing  After delivery  I got 4 new tires on the car  new floor mats  new battery  inspection II service  new wipers  and fluids  On and on an on  All under the pre certified warranty of the car  This warranty is a hell of a deal  and better than the new car warranty  Since my car was a lease return  all items requiring repair when the previous owner returned it were fixed  comes with the remaining factory warranty which is 4 years 50 000 miles  and an additional warranty for 2 more years up to 100 000 miles  All in all it was a great deal  for a great car that 146s nothing less than a BMW  maybe not the fastest  coolest or most expensive  but a nice stepping stone to getting there  
 This summer will be my seven year anniversary with my 1993 Geo Prizm  I bought this car when I graduated from high school  I gathered up my hard earned money and purchased what I now call the  quot Black Beauty quot  I was always jealous of my friends whose families were able to afford more expensive cars  but I made do with what I had  As it turns out  this car has been nothing less than dependable  I have taken it back and forth to the Bronx an uncountable amount of times  being a huge Yankee fan and Manhattan College student  Just imagine the wear and tear the car must have been through on those pot hole city streets but still never a problem  This car has also been on several road trips  Being a college student I would have to visit friends in far away places  For example  one summer my friends and I drove the black beauty all the way up to Vermont to the best keg party imaginable  Just think with an unreliable car we may have missed one of the best parties of the summer  Needless to say  the car is still in excellent shape for what I paid and I would say I have several more road trips to take with the Black Beauty br br  
 The 2000 Tauri is the best combination of performance and value this year  The new Taurus combines a slight body change with the same great features that have made it a best seller in the past  I just bought a 2000 SES sedan  and I absolutly love it  And keep in mind  I m a 19 year old college student  The car has room for myself and 3 or 4 friends to pile in and head out on a road trip  yet it still has the performance of a much small sedan  I raced it against my cousin s 2000 Merc Cougar AND SMOKED HIM BY 3 CAR LENGTHS  There simply isn t a better performance sedan on the market  except maybe the SHO  that can still get 25 mpg cruising the highway  I would highly recommend this car to anyone br br  
 You can incur major expense without needing major repairs  The fewer trips to the auto shop the better because these days  ANY repair is expensive  That s my main concern with my Sebring The Sebring Convertible will offer you beauty  style and pride of ownership  You also get a car that was manufactured with many low quality parts which means more trips to the shop  The good news is that most of your problems will not be serious  just expensive  O2 sensors  instrument panel blackouts  wheel bearings  bad brakes  cheap top motor and hydraulic cylinders  etc these common problems won t leave you stranded on the road side  but they cost money Then there s the car s  feel  The Sebring integrity is marginal  The car doesn t feel tight  It has its share of rattles and unidentified noises  making the ride feel sort of cheap  on certain roads  Your suspension will handle some types of road cracks well and others very poorly The windows are poorly designed so they rattle when not fully up or fully down  Your door glass will develop little  tracks  from rubbing the door frame as it moves up and down over time  Your lucky if your rear window defroster actually works  Your top will develop wear spots or pinch points over time  But if you are willing to deal with this car s many minor character flaws and irritations  you will love having one  I did a lot of research when I bought mine  What I discovered scared me  But I found one for a really good price   just couldn t pass it up  Am I sorry that I bought it  No way  The good out weighs the bad  My advice to would be buyers  if you are really attracted to the car and can get one for a good price   BUY IT  But realize that Chrysler built these with cheaper parts to keep the price competitive  And it worked  The Sebring Convertible is the best selling convertible ever  You can learn a GREAT deal of information about the Sebring by visiting  ezboard  at the link below http pub54 ezboard com fchryslersebringconvertiblemessageboardfrm1 
 We bought this car as a used program car with 50 000 miles on it just over 2 years ago and have put 30 000 trouble free miles on it  It has the 2 5 liter 4 cylinder engine which has more than enough power on flat ground and has no problem with hills even with 4 people in it  On the highway we get around 34 mpg and in combination city and highway driving get around 28 mpg  Our one and only complaint so far is with the paint  The car is grey and the paint on the hood and roof is flaking off  This  I have been told was a common problem in the early 90 s with grey and blue paint The interior is roomy and it also has a roomy trunk  The 60 40 bench seats are comfortable  but power seats would give you better adjustment  The car drives good  with good engine response and the 3 speed automatic transmission shifts very smooth I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for cheap  dependable transportation  but avoid grey or blue unless the car has been repainted or get the price lowered and get it done yourself at a reliable body shop br br  
 When it came time to buy a new car  not by choice  but rather because my old one that I d driven since my junior year of high school had taken to dying on me in not so timely places  I looked around quite a bit A 22 year old looking for his first NEW car can be quite a sobering experience I really liked the Volkwagen Jetta  the Acura Integra and the Toyota Celica  The problem with these cars was that they were running a little high on price  I was looking at paying between  20 000 and  27 000 with these cars when I felt my range was more  18 000 to  22 000  The Jetta did talk to me  with the fine German engineering and superb handling  I decided to take some time off from looking  frustrated at the difficult time I was having I told my salesman at Toyota to keep me in mind if he got something good Two weeks later I got a call from the same salesman telling me I had to come see this 99 Corolla LE they just got in  It was a factory car that only had 5500 miles on it I half heartily went in to see it and was actually impressed with it  For a little car it s pretty sporty  being a little car kind of guy   having only had a Nissan Sentra previously  and well laid out  The metallic black finish was very nice and the car handled extremely well  not as tight as the Jetta  but still very nice  The trunk is huge as well and it s more powerful than most cars of the same size  And the gas mileage  Prepare for much smaller bills at the end of the month My salesman and I added on a ton of features  including keyless entry alarm system  cd player  a spoiler  and the gold package for a total price of under  16 000  I traded in my Sentra  and got a whole  350 for it  and was on my way I ve had the car for 10 months now with no problems  I have felt no buyer s remorse and if I had it to do over again I would do it the same way  Toyota makes some wonderful products and I am quite pleased with the Corolla  For students or just price conscious shoppers in general  I d recommend it hands down br br  
 We were expecting our fourth child and knew that riding in two cars was just not economical or expectable  I always have wanted a mini van and to be honest never considered a Ford till shopping around  YES the sales people did make a difference  but what really did it for us was that we could get WHAT we wanted  for the price we wanted without upgrading it and getting every little add on  We chose the one we did because of the room  the simplicity  little computer components  which to us means lower repair bills  What really surprised us is the mileage  We have driven it to Florida twice now and it beat our Honda Accord hands down and was so much more comfortable  The turning ratio is not as good as some we drove  but the roominess and the comfort is fantastic and a better trade  I am overweight and everything fits me  which is another bonus We will always by one  just keep trading it up for a new one  I test drove them all and will never turn from the Windstar again br br  
 This is simply the best car I ve owned  Ford really thought things out and put a ton of  quot smart quot  features in this car  the easiest 60 40 seats in the industry  they drop out of sight when you need to open up the space in the back   quot hand grooves quot  in the top of the lift gate that allow for easy closing  clothes hooks that face out towards the doors  These are just some of the many details added I have two boys and we easily fit my wife  I  the boys  and three days of luggage  to include gold clubs  in the compartment as we spent three days in Monterey for Christmas  The gas mileage was excellent It s a mini SUV that handles like a car  incredibly tight steering radius  very quick 3 0 liter V6 engine I m not one for those big gas guzzlers that come with their own zip code   the Escape fits the bill  and fits in the garage  We re thinking of buying another for my wife  We bought ours for  23 000 out the door and it was fairly loaded  This is a MUST buy br br  
 That front is roomy but the drivers seat could go back further  My leg and foot gets crapped after about 45min s of driving  Needs cruise control but that is a  580 CAN  touch  Needs more power  any little up hill grade and it shifts down  The A C works great but take WAY to much power  Heater also uses a lot of power  The paint on the grill keeps chipping every time I was the bugs off  I have replaced the grill twice and still the same problem  I have only had the car a month and only 2 800km on the car  I would also like to see the car come with 15 inch wheels The sound system in the car is Great  It came with a SONY Explode Tape deck  I would like a CD player but that was  250CAN  extra  I can buy a New CD Deck of my choice for that price  
 After driving an Oldsmobile Silhouette mini van for several years  it was time to trade it in and get a new car  We test drove an  01 Silhouette  but kept going back to the  01 Buick LeSabre  We didn t get some of the  bells and whistles  I was used to on my mini van  but there are other options we are quite happy with   the Driver Information Center  for one  This is a really nice feature  to check one s range of travel on a tank of gas  to check tire pressure  oil pressure  etc  I really do miss my thermometer and compass from my van  but the compass IS available on certain LeSabre packages  The auto dimming rearview mirror is one of those  bells and whistles  I am really taken with now  and don t know how I would live without one in the future  One thing we were certain we wanted in a new car was the radio tape CD controls on the steering wheel  We were used to that  and feel that it is absolutely a necessary safety feature  we don t have to look down at the radio tape player CD player to control the volume  change stations  etc  thus endangering our lives and the lives of others on the road The LeSabre rides SO much smoother than the mini van  I feel I am riding on air  It handles beautifully   almost drives itself We had such a favorable experience with the dealership and salesman  we will certainly look at another Buick  when the time comes to trade in this car  
 I bought a 1994 Olds Cutlass Ciera SL with 78 000 km on it  The car now has 116 000 km on it  It has been reliable and virtually trouble free  I did not like the factory ride so I up graded the suspension to the heavy duty suspension  Although it is a little harsher on bumps etc it is a much better handling car Pros  good gas mileage for the size of car   34 mpg highway  comfortable ride for the size of car good family size car well equipped  power seats  windows  door locks  air conditioning  tilt etc  really good size trunk Cons poor in cross winds due to old styling  wind noise around the doors old styling again  I would prefer bucket seats rather than the 60 40 split front seat  Factory suspension too soft and sloppy Overall It is a comfortable  quiet car and I would buy another one br br  
  Leased a new Audi A4 2 8 Quattro in 1996  This absolutely one of the best cars I have ever driven  My family and friends believe so  too  Great looks and impressive drive packaged neatly for under  29 000 during our acquisition  I m happy to say it s worth almost every   I d hate to say  quot goodbye quot  to this wonderful car someday but another Audi  the A6  is  quot calling out my name quot Since  96  my A4 never seized to amaze me  I always feel proud each time I know I ll be taking it for a drive  I still admire its sleek lines and very modern design  The stock 16 quot  star patterned mag wheels and wide oval tires usually catch my attention  It s unfortunate that Audi doesn t equip the A4s with fog lamps underneath the front bumper like that of the A6  That will definitely keep me staring a bit longer  Nevertheless  the A4 is a beautiful car Entering the A4 finds no difficulty and immediately welcomes me into its magnificent cabin  The sport steering wheel  quot pulls my hands like a magnet quot  for a firm caress  I can t wait for those red instrument lights to go on  My seats hug me like I truly belonged  The gentle sound of the smooth V 6 invites me to roll those tires  Then  the rest is pavement history  This is not a fast car  but who needs another speeding ticket  This is a smooooth car  I d have to turn on the superb stereo system just to hear another great thing this machine can entertain me with  Then  I m usually tempted to search for the most winding roads the world has to offer  this is where the A4 is at its best element  The tighter the curve  the more impressive the car gets to be  The Quattro system and the highly developed A4 suspension are simply magical  This car can take any abuse you can dish out on it and still win over  This is also truly an all weather performer  This car kept me  amp  my family safe and secure even during the worst driving conditions  The A4 s performance hasn t let me down yet  and I don t expect it to Departing from the luxurious cabin and its well laid out ergonomics is  at most times  a sad moment for me  I m gonna miss all that I came to admire when I got in  With adoration  I tend to rub the wood trims that wrap around the dash and doors and shine on the center console  And  just like my entry  exiting is just as easy  Looking away is not There hardly things I can say to discredit this car  The only unusual problems I ve ever had in the 50 000 miles I ve accumulated so far are that of the window and moonroof mechanisms which tend to have a mind of its own occasionally  Audi dealership service usually relieves the problems for some time until they re occur  But  this doesn t bother me since I just love the service I get from Audi each time I bring my A4 in for service  Their bumper to bumper warranty is one of the best anywhere  And  this is all inclusive  oil changes  wiper blades  etc  are free of charge I have a little over 50 000 miles on my odometer now but I know this car will easily outlast my expectations  Ownership after the lease is definitely a good consideration  But  acquisition of other Audis is not far from my mind  Just like my A4  they ll most likely  quot make a believer out of me quot br br  
 My wife was ready to move out of our full size conversion van into a mini SUV 4X4 to handle the midamerican winters  We purchased the Sportage  over the CRV and Grand Vitara  primarily because of the price  appearance and front seat driver comfort  We paid  20 000 for our 2000 EX 4X4 We really like the driver comfort  the appearance  ease of storage in the back and relatively good gas mileage  Comfort on the highway is very good  although road noise is higher than normal  The items we would change include the location of the drink cup holders in front  add a button for door locks and a push button to open the rear hatch without inserting a key  Acceleration at all speed levels is terrible  but we knew that at the outset so it really is not a complaint It is very comfortable and fun to drive the Sportage around town and on short road trips  This is highly recommended for those who want a mini SUV at a very low price while enjoying good looks and a well appointed interior  If you are planning to tow anything  I would not recommend this  nor would I advise this if you are looking for great pickup around town and power on the highway br br  
 I can remember when the explorers first came on the market and I vowed I would someday own one  I loved the looks of them  At the time though we had only one child and room was not a factor  We have had our Explorer for almost 2 years and it wasn t the best choice of vehicles for us  We went from a Pontiac Minivan so the lack of room was definitely noticed  The kids never have enough room for their  quot stuff quot  and constantly fight over it  As far as driving an explorer  we needed a 4x4 because of our muddy roads and snow and it s rough riding  If you are wanting a leisurely drive I don t recommend the this vehicle  We have recently had some problems with it too  but it may be just OUR vehicle  It will not start on occasion and fortunately hasn t left me completely stranded  It will turn over but it sounds like it s out of gas  We took it in to get it checked but they can t figure it out  One minute it won t start and 5 minutes later it will      drives me crazy  In the are of comfort for me it s just not very appealing there either  I need room for my purse  and anything else I need for work and if I m the only one it s okay but get another adult in and there s just no room for us either I have to drive 18 miles one way to work every day so gas mileage is another factor  I only get around 17mpg  However  no matter what vehicle I choose I will be faced with this because I need a bigger vehicle that sits me up higher and has 4 x 4  Overall  I don t  quot hate quot  my explorer  but now that I ve had one I ve satisfied my curiosity and will not own another for a main vehicle  We should have chosen the expedition    If you have children I wouldn t recommend this vehicle if you want any room at all  However for a single person or two person family it would be fine  It will seat 5 but adults struggle to sit comfortably in the back     
 I 146m personally not a big fan of large SUVs  They use massive amounts of gasoline 151mileage is generally in the low teens 151and owing to their nearly three ton weight and high bumpers constitute a danger to anyone in a smaller vehicle  especially if that vehicle is a lower riding car or minivan  Yet even I am not entirely immune to their appeal  There is something fascinating about vehicles so large  probably the same thing that is fascinating about large beasts such as elephants and hippos  and large anything for that matter  Size is impressive to the animal brain  Recently I had a coupon for a free oil change at a Ford dealer  It was supposed to be a  147fast lube 148 but with nine cars in line ahead of me it was not  So I took the opportunity to indulge my revulsion fascination complex with large SUVs by taking a 2003 Expedition for a test drive My motivations were a bit more sophisticated than I have let on  I knew that Ford had substantially revised the Expedition for 2003  The revised styling follows the path set by the 2002 Explorer  with the largest change being a less round and more massive looking front end  Most intriguing to me  steering changed from recirculating ball to rack and pinion and the live rear axle was tossed in favor of an independent rear suspension to improve handling   Handling more than any other area affects my satisfaction with a vehicle  As in the 2002 Explorer  the new rear suspension permitted a much lower load floor  promising a larger rear seat There 146s also some history here  GM used to own the large SUV market  Then Ford finally got around to introducing its own full size four door SUV in 1997  and that first Expedition was instantly a success  GM responded with its own substantially redesigned large SUVs in 2000  and they 146ve regained some of the lost ground  This intense competition for high margin sales  large SUVs command much higher prices than mid sized SUVs  but do not cost that much more to produce  explains why Ford so substantially revised the Expedition for 2003 b Styling  As with the 2002   a href content 39524011652 Explorer a b   click for my review  I like the new styling much better than the old  The rounder front fenders of the first generation Expedition  as successful as they were at adapting Ford 146s aero look to a truck  were just a bit too pretty for a truck  The new styling makes the vehicle look stronger and more up to date  rounded forms are on their way  147out 148 without resorting to an overly macho theme  i e  the Avalanche  Some people complain that the Explorer and Expedition look too much alike  I don 146t have a problem with this personally  The point of styling is not to entertain auto journalists or third parties  The point is to give owners the  147look 148 they want  If they want the  147Ford SUV look 148 and the Explorer is large enough inside  then that 146s the way to go  If they want this look  but need a larger SUV  then that 146s what the Expedition is for  No one complains that Cheerios uses the same graphics on the 15oz and the 22oz box  right  And if every different size cereal box had a different look  wouldn 146t this lead to even more confusion in the cereal aisle  By similarly styling and naming its SUVs  Ford presents a clearer image and simplifies customers 146 decision making  Finally  wouldn 146t it be worse if they looked different  and people who only needed a mid sized SUV but really liked the look of the big one were thus forced to buy more gas guzzling truck than they need  So I have no problem with Ford SUVs looking alike Inside the Expedition has also been de rounded  The round forms of the old dash are gone  replaced by a more conventional arrangement  The most prominent features of the new dash are a large swath of black plastic across the driver 146s side and Audiesque rotating metallic finish rings that adjust the volume flowing through the vents  To my eye  the latter are much more aesthetically successful than the former  I 146m not sure what all of this black plastic is for  Minimizing glare  based on the Mercedes line of thinking  The Lincoln version isn 146t similarly blessed  so even if this is the line of reasoning Ford can 146t be too committed to it  Overall  I find the interior restyle less successful Ford claims that the new truck 146s interior materials are an improvement  with VW as the benchmark  They are an improvement 151this is a nicer interior than that of the new Explorer 151but VW is still a ways off  There 146s still a large amount of hard plastic to be found here   Accommodations  Hopefully  people who buy an Expedition do so for reasons beyond an infatuation with size  To whit  hopefully they need to carry a large amount of people and or stuff over nasty roads  or even off road  Let 146s cover the capacity issue first The Expedition is a big vehicle in all dimensions  length  wide  and height  This permits a large interior  even after allowing for generous ground clearance  Now  just about any car claims to fit three adults in the back seat  However  few have enough shoulder room to fit three comfortably  i e  shoulders not crammed into each other  middle person not sitting on a high  hard lump  etc  No problem here  All three rows have enough shoulder room for three adults to fit with little or no touching  A split bench is standard on the first two trim levels up front  so an Expedition can be configured to carry nine people  The upper trim lines  including the top of the line Eddie Bauer I drove  are fitted with buckets and a center console  I found the driver 146s seat fairly comfortable  especially after I deflated the lumbar support  an earlier driver had pumped it all the way up  I found the driving position much better than that in the current Explorer  In the Explorer  the windshield header and sun visors intruded on my vision  It was like a billed hat I couldn 146t take off  In the Expedition  I sat well above the dash  affording an excellent view out all around  yet the top of my vision was also unblocked  Much  much better  No improvements possible here  Huge mirrors were also much appreciated Many cars these days do not provide enough interior storage  No problem with the Expedition I drove  The center console  which reduces seating capacity to eight  has a HUGE storage compartment in it  A small dog could be stored in there or  more likely  a laptop computer and or good sized purse  This compartment was topped by a padded leather armrest  Also nice  Smaller storage areas are scattered throughout the interior The Eddie Bauer Expedition I drove had the  147climate control 148 seats  These include not only heating  but also air conditioning  each with five strength settings  I set the seat A C to  1475 148 but never noticed a difference  I would suggest saving  625 by forgoing this option  except it 146s the only way to get heated seats  and these can be very nice to have on cold mornings with leather  You 146re call  just know the seat A C isn 146t worth much In the second row  the truck I drove had a bench split in three pieces  The middle piece can be slid forward  to position it closer to the front row  something parents with small children might like  Two captains chairs separated by a center console with a large storage compartment  as in the Lincoln Navigator  are a  795 option  Be aware that while the seats fold the console will not  so with all seats folded it sticks up a few inches above the otherwise nearly flat load floor  Second row seat comfort is pretty good  definitely better than that in most smaller SUVs and minivans  The seat cushion is nearly high enough to provide good thigh support  The cushion is padded and contoured enough so you don 146t feel you 146re sitting on a board  To get to the third row  either outboard section of the second row tilts forward in two fairly easy steps   Not quite easy enough for children to manage  which might not be a bad thing The real surprise is in the third row  Ford 146s main reason for eating the approximately  200 additional cost of an independent rear suspension was to avoid packaging a center differential with 10 148 or so of travel  This permitted the floor to be lowered nine inches  a huge amount  This lower floor permits two things  First  it permits a surprisingly roomy third seat  Now  many vehicles these days offer a third row seat  including many minivans and an increasing number of SUVs  I 146ve sat in many of these third row seats  I didn 146t sit in them any longer than I had to  though  They tend to be uncomfortable  and they tend to be mounted so close to the floor that my knees are at chest level  I don 146t like sitting like this  In the Expedition  in contrast  the seat cushion is generously sized and padded and is mounted high enough above the lower floor that I had plenty of thigh support  move even than in the second row  Overall  I found the third row seat to be the most comfortable in the vehicle  more comfortable than the second seats in most alternatives are far ahead of any third row seat I 146ve sampled  Among SUVs  only the even larger Suburban comes close  Quite an achievement The lower floor also permits this large  comfortable seat to fold completely into it  leaving a flat load surface behind  Ford faced a choice here  They could have used the lower floor to expand cargo volume by making the seats removable  as before  They elected instead to keep cargo volume constant 151and thus substantially less than a minivan s 151and eliminate the need to remove any seats  ever  I suspect the great majority of buyers will favor this decision  as removing and storing seats tends to be quite inconvenient  For maximum cargo volume  though  a minivan remains a better choice  as the reduced ground clearance and removable seats permit a taller cargo area My test vehicle had the  455 power folding third row option  Worth the  455  Probably not to me  but I 146d suggest personally evaluating the effort involved in the non power version b On the Road  The revisions for 2003 have added a few hundred pounds to an already hefty vehicle  So even with the 260 horsepower 5 4 liter V8 acceleration is just adequate with a moderate load  By this I mean it felt neither underpowered nor equipped with power to spare  It moved as quickly as I wanted to  which admittedly is not too quickly  this being a large vehicle   The   a href content 6904319620 Toyota Sequoia a b  is about equally powerful  the GM SUVs have an edge here  Towing a heavy load and or carrying a full load of passengers might lead some people to desire more power  but as I did neither I cannot say  I can say that even when pushed the engine sounded quieter and more sophisticated than past Expeditions and competing GM products  With the accelerator floored  the transmission shifted well short of the redline  at about 5500 RPM  perhaps because going above that level on an engine with a low power peak makes no sense Handling was another pleasant surprise  The steering and brake efforts were nicely firm where they used to be overly light  Roll in turns is moderate  Unlike past Expeditions  I no longer felt I was driving a boat  Not a sports car  either  but I generally felt the new Expedition could be handled with adequate precision and  perhaps most important  a sense of control  Overall  its handling felt similar to that of the Toyota Sequoia  Sadly  the ride is not quite up to the almost Lexus like Sequoia 146s or even the Tahoe s  Over some surfaces the generally composed if not quite luxurious ride felt a bit jittery  though never uncomfortably rough  Still  I never felt the degree of body on frame shimmer that turned me off the current Explorer  Overall  ride qualoty is adequate  but I expect better The interior is fairly quiet  even at highway speeds  with one qualification  Whenever the A C was on  at any setting  a loud blower stayed on at the rear of the vehicle  I tried and failed to find a way to cut this blower off without turning the A C completely off  I think this blower recirculates air  pulling it through a vent at the very back  but even turning off  147recirc 148 didn 146t kill it  There has got to be a better way  On the positive side  the climate control system appears well up to handle the task of heating and cooling all three rows of this large vehicle   Pricing  The moderately loaded Eddie Bauer Expedition I drove carried a sticker of  45 190  Yes  quite shocking  But corrective actions are possible  The new  147safety canopy 148  airbag to protect the first and second rows in a rollover  and  147AdvanceTrac 148  stability control  are impressive safety features  but together add nearly  1 400 to the sticker  I 146ve already mentioned the climate controlled seat and power folding seat options  another  1 080  Not yet mentioned is the nicely sized but  800 moonroof  Yet more can be saved by going with the XLT trim  where the luxury of leather is still available  Equip an XLT to   a href content 68354674308 Honda Pilot EX a b  levels  and the sticker drops under forty  Still nine grand over the smaller but in some ways nicer Honda  but more help is on the way  The Honda sells at or above sticker  while according to Edmunds Ford dealers typically accept four grand under sticker  Add in Ford 146s current  2 500 rebate  and the likely transaction price for a still well equipped Expedition comes to just over  33 000  Suddenly the price seems quite reasonable  doesn 146t it  Even further reductions are possible by doing without leather  front buckets  and so on GM s full size SUVs  such as the   a href content 75746086532 GMC Yukon a b  tend to cost a bit more than the Expedition  For reasons discussed in my review of the Yukon  I prefer the Ford The   a href content 6904319620 Toyota Sequoia a b  costs much more than the Ford or GM SUVs  even though dealers are finally discounting them  The big Toy is more refined  but low on power and not as roomy  I prefer the Ford b Last Words  Generally I 146d still recommend a smaller  more fuel efficient vehicle  but if you need to carry seven or more  adults  comfortably  there are few other choices  and those aren 146t much more efficient  For many uses  a minivan will do as well or better  but off road and or travel over uneven or unplowed snow covered roads can justify the space robbing  weight adding ground clearance of the Expedition  With these qualifications  I can recommend this vehicle  With the changes for 2003  the seating comfort  interior versatility  and handling feel now exceed the closest competition  Acceleration  some areas of handling  and ride quality still lag  but among large SUVs this is now my favorite b Update November 2003 b This fall Nissan has entered the large SUV arena with its Pathfinder Armada and Dodge has introduced a new  singificantly larger Durango  After driving both my preference for the Expedition remains  though the Dodge is a close second  The new Durango is much quicker than the Expedition  feels more maneuverable  rides better  and costs less  Its disadvantages include a less comfortable third row  less shoulder room  and a cheap looking interior  The Nissan is also much quicker than the Ford  but its chassis feels very trucky and its interior quality is abysmal for a  40 000 vehicle I ve noticed that Expeditions  front wheels are often thickly coated with black brake dust  They appear to have a problem in this area  If you must always have a clean looking car  plan on washing this one s wheels often My reviews of related vehicles b a href content 75746086532 GMC Yukon a b   equivalent to

 I took one look at the Ford Focus ZX 3 hatch back  and thought  quot That can t be a Ford quot  But a Ford it is my dear friends and neighbors The Focus looks fun just sitting there  with a sexy sleek front end and lines any airplane designer would be proud of You don t drive this little big car as much as wear it  Climb on in and you will find firm yet comfortable seats with the ability to raise or lower in height  Side bolsters offer additional support and will keep you in place when you re whipping this little tiger around the twisties several engine options are available  save yourself from having to make a decision  get the ZTECH 2 0 liter DOHC with the 5 speed manual transmission  It turns the Focus into a ROCKET  Controls are all within easy reach and are located exactly where they should be  You won t find yourself searching for buttons or dials  just look down and there they are  I upgraded to the cd player and boy I m glad i did  It sounds like a big money system with clear highs and plenty of thump in the lows  turn on the automatic volume control and the dang thing turns itself up or down to compensate for ambient road noise If you want a sporty car without sacrificing comfort and trunk storage space  then take a test drive  Then look at the sticker  Then look again and it will be hard not to seriously consider this car br br  
 Firstly  let me start off by saying  I initially was interested in the Audi A6 2 7t Quattro  In my humble opinion the best damn SPORT SEDAN out there  Now this was before I test drove and eventually bought a VW PASSAT GLS V6 with 4motion  This car is amazing My girlfriend and I researched a number of cars  this car was to be my first car purchased here in New York  Her emphasis was on safety and mine on looks and performance  You could say she was my  voice of reasoning  Which I must admit in the end saved me  10 000  Because after driving that A6 2 7T QUATTRO  I was ready to sell my kidney and other donor parts to have it  She had to drag me out of the dealership  and put me on in a rehab clinic  I was addicted to that A6 2 7T Quattro Well after recovering  I began reflecting on my previous car a VW GOLF GTI  a true  pocket rocket  Needless to say I have always liked Europe based VW vehicles  But I wasn t too impressed with what was coming to the US  carrying the VW tag  I began looking at the competition  and there were some good stiff challengers out there  It seems nearly all new sedans are bit mechanically the same  However  this is far from the truth once you get to know an German built car e g  AUDI  luxury line of VW  After reading a few hundred reviews I seemed to end back to VW  So I decided before auctioning my organs lets take a look at this Passat One general observation  in the US Asian car manufactures always had an edge on German cars when comparing interior design and ergonomics for passengers  However  all drivers knew a German car is built with driver in mind only  It seems someone at VW was listening and watching because the new Passat blends the perfect chemistry of driver convenience and passenger comfort it a beautiful package called the PASSAT The build quality is truly luxury  One look at this cars interior and you would swear your looking at an AUDI  The new Passat seems to be based on a stretched out Audi A4  If you re like me and believe the AUDI A6 2 7t Quattro is a beautiful car  but your financial situation cannot handle the expense of an AUDI  then have no fear the PASSAT is here and ready to be had at your closest VW dealership The 4 motion systems AWD  is basically the same as the Quattro and gives the driver an assurance  wherever you point this car that is the line it is going to take  For you performance types  the  triptronic  is a gem  This system gives you the best of both worlds AUTO for everyday driving and semi manual for performance handling through those winding roads  I am still breaking my car in as I brought it 11 30 01 with 2 miles on the odometer  I can t wait until I reach 1000miles and truly open up the engine My car specs are as follows GLS V6 4MOTION with triptronic INDIGO BLUE w beige leather Leather Package  Homelink  Monsoon CD Changer  and dealer ALLOYS for  600  
 I recently went out and test drove one of these puppies  and here are a few random thoughts I had from this experience In the event of a head on collision  the car s engine is designed to separate for the car s frame and drop to the ground  I guess consumers don t take too highly to being crushed by the engine It s a snug fit  There is very little space between the seat and the door  The armrest is a stand alone console between the driver and passenger seats  and has a good amount of storage space for CDs and other things The back seat has very little legroom  and is a bit cramped  Even if the front seat person moves the seat forward  very little room is yielded   There are special child seat restraints and three seatbelts in the back  Not exactly a huge family vehicle  but equipped with child safety locks  and other amenities Really good power  for such a tiny little car  Surprising  in fact  You step on the gas pedal  and it moves  Handles very good around corners Speaking of corners  what is that loud clicking sound  Oh It s just the turn signal  I guess Ford wants to help eliminate those annoying motorists who drive 6 miles down the road before realizing their blinker has been on the whole time  Since the turn signal is about as loud as a Mark McGwire home run swat  I would say they are well on their way to accomplishing this goal All the doors automatically lock once the car exceeds 5 MPH Very good vision when driving  You cannot see the hood of the car  The wind shield affords a wide view  There is a moderate amount of noise  and you may have to turn up the radio just a bit when accelerating to higher speeds The clutch is very easy to push down on  and transitioning from one gear to other is very smooth with the exception of reverse  It was quite a task to put the vehicle in reverse  You almost have to lift up on the gear stick  It took about a minute and a half to figure this out the first time  and about 30 45 seconds to do each time after that There is no RPM gauge  Only this annoying light that comes on  telling you when to shift up or down  and usually at the slightest amount of acceleration  I guess Ford thinks I m not smart enough to know when to shift The car gets pretty good gas mileage  at 25 34 MPG  but I would expect more from such a small car This car has a lot of truck space  although its much longer than it is deep  When loading the truck  you really have to come forward into the trunk  rather than placing objects down into it  There is a hatch release lever inside that  VERY useful if you are ever car jacked  and forced into the trunk  while the robber makes his getaway  The back seats also pull down in a 1 3  2 3 configuration for added capacity Overall this is not a bad car  but at a price of about 17 grand  it is WAY over priced  I see this car as the exact duplicate of what the Escort used to be when it first came out  If you are looking for a car that will get you to where you re going  then this will do  But the price tag is just offensive  and was the main reason we did not buy  
 The title of this epinion sums up this car  The car is not flashy  it is not stylish  it does not look great but is is reliable and that I think is really the most important feature of an automobile  I do not want to be driving down the street and have my car break down  this is my second Ford Escort and for the seven plus years that I have driven this type of car I can honestly say that they have been extremely reliable  I also must say that the handling on the car is good too  The car does not have any problems on turns at all  Mileage on the car could be better but guess that in part has to do with the rising price of gas  If you are looking for a sturdy car  get this one you will not be disappointed in it br br  
 When my sister graduated from high school  she got a Ford Mustang  It was blue  and it was FAST  When i graduated 10 years later  my parents got smart and gave me my moms 1995 Ford Escort  It has 4 doors and a 4 cyclinder engine  I must say I felt a little jipped on the deal  But I am happy they gave me the car  instead of making me buy one on my own  The car runs good  Even after having it 5 years  and putting it through the hell that teenagers do  I have put 75 000 miles on it  Replace 3 sets of tires    only because i forget to rotate them  I have also had to replace 3 batteries at this point  But i think thats more of the mechanics fault than the car  My car has a spoiler on the back  I guess my mom thought that added a bit of coolness to the car  HA  Overall its a good car  I still have it  And now it carries my hubby  child and me  I am shopping for a new car  The car is nice when you dont have kids  There just isnt enough room for everything  So if you are single  or you are married with no kids and want a cheap car  this one works well     
 We bought our Ford Taurus Wagon in 1993  It was a 1988 model and had 2 former owners  It has been a gem until 2 months ago  We are the kind of people who run our vehicles and don t take very good care of them  Sure we change the oil  sometimes  We never take it for check ups unless it s sick  lol  We have had a good time in this car  We have taken it everywhere we went  It has been a great one  The convenience of the 3rd seat in the rear is great  When we have extra children to take it really comes in handy  When the 3rd seat is down it locks and you can put your personal things in there and lock it so nobody knows it s there  Like when you go somewhere that you don t want to carry your purse or if you have packages and you go in another store This car gets great gas mileage  Even though these cars look long and hard to drive they are actually easy to drive  You can see everything around you and the mirrors work great  I would recommend this car to everyone who wants a wagon  As a matter of fact they are hard to come by  When we were looking to buy one  every time we went to a lot looking for one we were told they are hard to come by     
 A drove a 1998 Celica with a 5 speed stick a while back when I was looking for a unique car to use for short summer runs  I saw the black on black 5 speed with all options at a local dealer  and it was a certified vehicle carrying a warranty  First off  the dealer was very pushy in trying to get me into a new Sequoia and other high profit vehicles I did manage to get the car out for a ride  alone  It shifted almost as well as my S70 T5  but the interior is even more cramped than a Geo Chevy Metro  The interior was up to Toyota quality fit and finish and looked relatively attractive and extremely clean for a used car  The ergonomics were excellent  although the same cannot be said for the comfort  visibility or room The car s engine does not seem to match what Toyota makes the car out to be  Mine had the uplevel 2 2L 4 cylinder  and it was able to move the light car along fairly well  although not as fast as some newer  cheaper cars  This is not a real stoplight racer  although it is possible  The car sure is an attention getter  in almost all the colors  But most of the attention is probably from the guys in the white and black cars   luckily  the engine won t make these people too mad The price   16 900  High  Very  Why would somebody buy a used car for  16 900  If you buy a Toyota  you will pay more for what may well be an excellent car  This is not a car for teens  as it is classified as a sports car  and on top of initial cost  insurance premiums are over the top  My advice  If you are looking for a sports car  get a late model Z28 Firehawk from Chevy Pontiac  With the ax officially down on the Camaro  it is probably a somewhat safe investment  Plus  can anyone resist the sound of an American v8  
 As soon as the new Maxima came out in 2000  I absolutely had to have one  Still a poor college student  I was forced to wait  But in 2001 I finally bought a Maxima GXE  and it s everything I ever wanted in a car First  there s tremendous performance  The 2001 Maxima comes standard with a 222hp V6 DOHC engine  That means the car can really get up and go  The Maxima is capable of going from 0 60 in about 6 seconds  And not only is the engine powerful  it s also high quality  In 2001 Ward s Auto World  the reigning engine authority  put the Maxima s engine in its  10 Best  list for the seventh consecutive year  a new record  Ward s said   There isn t a better V6 in all of automobiledom   regardless of price Second  and equally important  is handling  Not only does the Maxima have power  but you can really harness it  The car handles like a beauty  The cornering  braking  etc  is very responsive and makes the car easy to drive Third is the aura of luxury  The car looks and feels like luxury car  It has a sporty classy look on the outside  and the interior is really nice  Many cars  even some of Nissan s other models  have a sort of  cheap  feel to the interior  The Maxima  however  feels very plush  even at the most basic trim level  Finally  there are a lot of smaller features on the car  The dashboard consoles are very well designed and laid out  making them easy to use  There are stereo and cruise controls right on the steering wheel though  so you may never need to touch the console  The rear seats fold down to increase the trunk space  which came in handy when I brought a Christmas tree home  The Maxima offers keyless entry and has a computer chip in the key so the car won t start without it  Between the driver and passenger seats is an adjustable armrest with a lot of storage space inside  it s great for storing CDs  Even the beverage holder between the seats is  adjustable  so it can handle unusually large  e g  1 liter bottles  beverages  The driver s window has one touch up down  The rearview mirror has an auto dimmer  which is very nice when you re driving at night I considered other makes models in this class  including the Camry  Accord  Taurus  Passat  and Impala  Although all are lower priced  except maybe the Passat  not one of them had the performance and style of the Maxima  in my opinion You can read reviews about this car on a number of automotive type websites  The reviews usually include a phrase about how much fun the car was to drive or how they had to pry the keys out of the test driver s hands  It s also a perennial winner in terms of roominess for its class If you re considering a sedan  you d be well served to take a look at the Maxima  If the car is just for a driver  i e  not a family hauler  I don t think you ll find a more driver centric car in this class  
 We purchased a 99 Windstar earlier this year  We bought it as a replacement for our previous minivan a 1996 Ford Windstar  I was one of those moms who hated the idea of a minivan  hated the size  hated the image it evoked  However  once i drove my van  I had to admit I loved it  Why a minivan  Convenience  comfort  and safety were the keys  Why a Windstar  the safety record was impressive  when we drove it  it handled like a car  it was easy to drive  and responded well  When we went to buy a new one  i honestly didn t look at anything but another Windstar  I love the design of the windstar  we never had any problems with it other than the door molding coming off  and the brakes needed replacing once  Brakes are a consumable item  I expect that  Our new 99 Windstar has the dual sliding doors  although not the automatic ones  I love the sliding doors on both sides  Its very convenient when dealing with 2 older kids and one in a carseat  I like the fact that the bench seat in our Windstar can be placed to either side of the car  That makes only one side accessible from the third row bench  but that works well for us  We can change which side our kids get out on  and it allows us to know where they are  and have them get out on the same side of the car I do  so I know they aren t going out into traffic etc  Having the sliding door on the other side allows me to put the baby in and out without having to get half into the van and on my knees so its a great convenience  We travel a lot  and the Windstar has more than enough room for our family of five plus all of our gear  The dual air zones are great too  Overall  I have been extremely happy with the Windstar minivan  It looks good  it drives well  and has that added advantage of being able to separate small people so you don t have to hear  quot she s touching me quot  Everyone has their own space  and everyone gets a window seat br br  
 The Volvo wagon is a great car overall  with only a few shortcomings  It handles very well and runs quietly  The angle of the back of the car allows more storage  as it is more vertical than other wagons  The seats are easy to adjust and put down for additional storage  The great thing about this car is that it is roomy  The front seat is more spacious than others I tried  and I am only 5 9 quot  It is also wider than others  so during the winter months the bulk of the winter coats isn t too binding  As for the negatives about this car  The drink holders in this model are limited  Just two in the center arm rest up front  They are relatively delicate too  Mine broke  but was replaced for free  They are small too  so they fit only for cans or skinny water bottles  The back seat holders are much better  The car completely lacks CD storage  which is strange since a CD player is standard  There is limited tape storage  but it is beneath the drink holders  so the drinks have to be removed to open that area  The window frames of the back seat doors are pretty thick  such that the blind spot check is a bit trickier than other cars  It s just more difficult to see behind on the drivers side That s about it  but interior amenities aside  the car is great br br  
 My first car was a 1967 Mustang  289 cu in automatic with turn signals on the hood and a black vinyl roof over yellow paint job  Today this car would be the ultimate classic ride  Now in the nineties  I have owned three new Mustang s  95  97  99  and I believe that Ford is on the right track to making me as happy as the first one  The body style of the 1999 s is quite a bit different from the other two  With a rounder body and square like head  amp  tail lights this is more like a Toyota body style If I had a dollar for every person that told me   quot I love your car quot  or  quot cool car  man quot  it probably would be enough to make one of the payments  All three of these vehicles were five speed transmission s because I just love to drive  Living out in the hill country of Texas  not far from IH 10 it is easy to get down the road and make it to one of the big cities  Never had a bit of trouble with any of these vehicles and I easily put 4 to 5 thousand miles a year on the first two  With the MachI CD stereo system the road becomes a joy to own  The 95 was not a GT and the difference is quite noticeable during acceleration  I would recommend the 4 liter over the 3 liter engine if you do a lot of highway driving  One thing you may have to get used to is other  quot sporty quot  cars pulling alongside and begging you to have a race  This takes a little getting used to especially when most of the time it would be no problem to blow their doors off  Take a walk on the wild side with a new Ford Mustang Ford also sent me a fantastic gift package containing a three cd set of music from the 60 s  70 s  amp  80 s and a wonderful black leather mustang cd case as well as a hard cover edition of the  quot History of Mustang quot  Try and beat this deal br br  
 Extremely late in the scene  Mitsubishi has decided to join the band wagon of crossover vehicles wagons on the market with their very own version titled  Outlander  With a base price just a hair under 18 grand  this puts the Outlander s starting price close to the same price range as the less premium brand s competition  i e  the Hyundai Santa Fe and Kia Sorento  Mitsubishi has yet to impress me with most of their 2002 model line up  with their cheaply made vehicles  weak powertrains  high prices etc  Is the 2003 Outlander any different For the 2003 model year  the all new Outlander comes available in 2 trim lines  LS  tester  and XLS  both trim lines are available in either all wheel drive or 2 wheel drive  tester  For 2003 the Outlander is only available with 1 engine  a SOHC 2 4 liter 4 cylinder pumping out 140 horsepower and 157 lb ft of torque  1 transmission is also available  a 4 speed automatic with sport shift   Driving Impressions i  I have never been a big fan of this particular 2 4 unit which is carried over from the Galant Eclipse  this SOHC 2 4 4 cylinder seems unrefined and overly noisy under full throttle in the Galant Eclipse and even more so in the Outlander  Torque is reached at a fairly low RPM  so off the line  acceleration  is relatively strong  however the curb weight and aerodynamics quickly start to pull on the reigns of the 140 horses produced from the Outlander s 4 cylinder  While not exactly slow  the 2003 Outlander would greatly benefit in acceleration if a 6 cylinder engine  or even a turbocharged set up similar to what is found in the Chrysler PT Cruiser Turbo was standard  I feel Mitsubishi should have at least made a V6 optional  especially to accommodate the heavier AWD models  The 4 speed automatic with sport shift enables the driver to manually shift without the use of a clutch  The automatic transmission is smooth  never clunking into gear  My only qualm with this transmission is that if you are not using the sport shift feature and are cruising at a high speeds the transmission would sometimes down shift for no apparent reason  The Outlander is like the Chrysler PT Cruiser and many other small SUV wagons in the sense that it is based on a small car s platform  in the Outlander s case the Mitsubishi Lancer s platform  Being based on a car s platform does not necessarily mean the vehicle is going to handle like a car  however the Outlander did much better than expected on the twistys  giving more of a car like ride than many SUVs that claim that they  handle like a car  Body lean roll can be a little alarming on sharp corners  although no more so than your average mid sized family car On the freeways or when driving on the back roads the Outlander offered a much better ride than I had forecasted  Despite being noisy and somewhat slow accelerating  the Outlander did an exceptional job on the freeway keeping itself composed and virtually noise free at  cruising  speeds around 65 MPH  Again  the transmission down shifted a few times for no reason making for unnecessary engine noise  but overall did a great job keeping the driver in a calm environment  This smooth cruising is only limited however to straight stretches of road  While many people who buy the 2003 Outlander will not have to climb steep mountains to get to work everyday  many potential buyers will  The Outlander was not made for smooth hill climbing  Even with its decent amount of torque  and relatively light curb weight  under 3 500 lbs  the 2WD Outlander was hard pressed to maintain any cruising speed in high gear while driving up even slight inclines  The Outlander did an adequate job climbing these hills once the transmission down shifted  although the engine seemed overly rambunctious  making for much more hill climbing noise than many small SUVs with similar powertrains  i e the Honda CRV or the Chrysler PT Cruiser   Braking  is adequate  nothing really to write home about  and nothing really to complain about  The front disc rear drum set up could be improved with ABS  nevertheless braking was good enough for panic stops without having to floor the brake pedal  One might note that 4 wheel disc brakes coupled with 4 wheel ABS is available on the XLS trim as a  500 option  however is not available on the LS  tester b Fuel Economy  is about average for a vehicle in this class  The EPA rates the 2 4 liter Outlander at 21 26  this is about 1 MPG better than the automatic equipped PT Cruiser  The AWD LS and XLS receive slightly lower EPA ratings at 20 25 i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the 2003 Mitsubishi Outlander is probably my biggest gripe with this vehicle  Even though standard amenities are abundant  it s the quality of the plastics  the seating etc  etc  that have me complaining  Mitsubishi has come up with an interesting titanium dash theme  however the simulated strip that lines the majority of the front dash fascia is made out of cloth  While cloth on the dash might seem quite novel to many consumers at first glance  it just doesn t make much sense to me  the dash is a place that gets very dirty very easily  with only 75 miles on my tester there were already fingerprints and visible dirt on the cloth  it would be much easier to clean simulated titanium plastic metal than delicate cloth  The titanium colored cloth strip also seems like it would be much more prone to wear  The plastics used throughout the cabin feel and look cheap  The plastic map pockets on the doors move with little effort and the plastic door handles feel overly flimsy  The center console  which also doubles as an arm rest  seems too small  and is wrapped in the same cheap feeling cloth as the seats  Mitsubishi obviously did some major cost cutting to keep the base price of the Outlander as low as possible  Despite the cheap materials  the Outlander comes very well equipped in base trim  My LS came with only 1 option  an excellent sounding 140 watt Mitsubishi sound system with 6 speakers  Standard on the LS comes power everything  including a power antenna  cruise control  an 8 way adjustable drivers seat  dual air bags  an analog clock housed in the center of the dash  cup holders  and air conditioning  For more info on standard and optional equipment you can visit  www Mitsubishicars com b  One might note that the Outlander comes with tons of optional equipment  so if you are in the market for a small SUV and the base amenities in the Outlander are not enough  Mitsubishi makes sure all the luxury amenities are available  especially with the XLS trim Seating is good  in the respect that the drivers seat allows for a good driving position  although I was really turned off by the feel of these cloth seats  Instead of using a soft velour or even a standard cloth material  Mitsubishi has used a webbed cloth for the base trim lines  which not only felt cheap  but felt like they would wear terribly with the stains of time  Room and storage is about average for a small wagon SUV  comparable to the head  leg  and storage room in the Toyota Matrix  PT Cruiser  Hyundai Santa Fe  Head and leg room in both the front and in back of Outlander was more than enough for my 5 6  body without feeling cramped  I imagine people over 6  will have no problem with the creature space provided  The rear seats are 60 40 split which fold down completely making for plenty of stowage space for a long vacation   Exterior Innovation i The Outlander is a handsome vehicle  however it does not boast any sort of originality in the looks department  aside from the beefy  all Mitsubishi  front fascia  Looking like many small SUVs wagons on the market  the Outlander will most likely not turn any heads  This common styling is not a major gripe by any means  however Mitsubishi could have went a little further segregating the Outlander from the herd of other small SUVs on the market  If you want to add to the look of your Outlander  Mitsubishi offers many optional colors  and stylish alloy wheels  The standard wheels are made of steel and come with plastic wheel covers   Price Warranty i  Base price for the Outlander LS starts out just a shade under 18 grand  price as tested  18 577 before taxes  add AWD and the price rises to over 19 grand  add all optional amenities and the price skyrockets to almost  24 000  The XLS with all options including AWD can rise to a whopping  26 000  Standard warranty includes 3 year 36 000 mile bumper bumper coverage  and a 5 year 60 000 mile powertrain warranty   Final Thoughts i The Mitsubishi Outlander s base price may seem very attractive  although I personally would not pay the MSRP for this vehicle  The Outlander has many drawbacks  the interior seems cheap  options can be quite costly  acceleration performance could be improved dramatically  and ABS should come standard  I do not recommend the Outlander LS 2WD  If you are in the market for a 2WD vehicle in this class I suggest looking elsewhere  The Toyota Matrix  Hyundai Santa Fe  and the Pontiac Vibe  to name a few  are some wagons that seem to offer much more bang for the consumer s buck  If you are a hardcore Mitsubishi fan  I suggest waiting for the slightly larger Mitsubishi Endeavor  available in Jan 2003  which seems to be promising wagon based on the Galant s platform Looking for a more exciting vehicle in this class  Check out my review on the    a href content 79551499908  Toyota Matrix a     Happy Car Shopping  
 I bought the cheapest American made I m a patriot  so sue me  truck I could find  and it is a Ford Ranger with no options save the am fm stereo  which I begrudgingly accepted As far as automobiles go  I would consider myself an audiophile  and car audio is the major concern that leads me to think negatively about this particular truck  For some reason  Ford insists on using 5 quot x7 quot  speakers in many of their light trucks  The reason this is a problem is because aftermarket 5 quot x7 quot  speakers can be hard to find  Even harder to find are top quality speakers in this size arrangement  All that can be circumvented by inconveniently using the incorrect size for the available speaker mounting  Of course  unless you really know what you re doing  Mr  Car Stereo Installer will charge you around  50 to make sizers so that they fit properly That is just the beginning of the problem  Unlike many other trucks  the Ranger has almost no room underneath the seats  What this means is that  short of a minor miracle  you can t place an external amplifier anywhere but behind the seats  This arrangement creates another problem  If a subwoofer were to be installed along with that amplifier  the entire jack assembly behind the seat needs to be removed  Due to this  my jack is now underneath my passenger seat  Not a real problem  but lets say another amp were added for better fidelity and volume  two amps and a subwoofer enclosure are almost impossible to fit behind the seats in this narrow cab  This is where the underseat space comes into play  because with many other light pickups  an amp could be placed under either seat  facilitating greater flexability in the setup behind the seat   such as two subwoofers or a subwoofer and a pair of 6 quot x9 quot  enclosures Now  I realize no car truck is perfect  However  a new car should be relatively problem free for the first year in my opinion  Inside of the first 6 months  I experienced the following problems  Straight from the dealer  the plastic molding on the right front pillar wasnt installed properly  The interior light for  ironically  the lighting controls ceased functioning  The dashboard developed a persistent  and very annoying  creak  The seat developed a slight tear  And  lastly  the wheel alignment went astray to the right  The conclusion that I have to draw is that the Ranger is not the most rugged of vehicles  which is a bit disappointing  it being a truck and all  Overall  the vehicle has not been a vast disappointment  The gas mileage has been right where the sticker said it should be  I have not needed to have any routine parts  such as headlights or turn signal bulbs  replaced  The suspension is a bit bumpy  but that s to be expected from a truck  The power steering works great  although  on my particular vehicle  the right tire rubs against the wheel well if the steering wheel is turned completely to the right  The manual transmission is tight  and the engine produces good pickup for a 4 cylinder  The tires that come standard with the vehicle are terrible on anything but dry pavement  My final analysis of the Ford Ranger is that it is a servicable vehicle  but nothing I could find myself recommending to a friend  or waiting in anticipation to buy

 I purchased my used 2002 Ford Windstar in January 2003  We had a 1998 Ford Expedition 4X4 that had a lift kit and 33  tires   dual exhaust   the works that we traded in on it  Man was I stupid   I guess     Over all I guess the 2002 Ford Windstar is ok   I like the ride that it gives you   The looks of the Windstar are another pro of mine   I am generally a GM person my self  wife likes the Fords  and I am not to fond of the Chevy Venture body style   The Windstar does have about the best braking system I have seen for a while with the exception of the all time Ford brake dust on the rims problem   One thing that my wife and I truely love is the VHS Tv entertainment system   We have two daughters and one more on the way   12   14 months   due in April   The entertainment system keep them so QUIET   There are some quirks that I am not real pleased with   The rear heat only blows from the drivers side rear side panel near the floor  it is extremely noisy if you turn the fan up to the second fan setting or higher  I dont understand why they couldn t have designed it so that when you want the heat to blow hot it would come from the roof vents as well  The engine is extremly noisy when you first start it   it sounds like something is sucking a lot of air in it   it generally clears up after a minute or so  The engine is fairly noisy if you try to pass someone  The Windstar has the typical Ford electrical problems  Every Ford I have ever owned has had moderate Electrical problems   I have had problems with the brake lights staying on after the vehicle is parked and you have gotten out of the vehicle   I took it to the dealer to have it fixed but it never would do it for them  isn t that always the case  The 1998 Expedition I had   right before I traded it in I was spending about  400 00 each month for about 3 4 months on electrical repairs  I have had to have the sway bar links replaced   warranty  because of a clunking noise I would hear when I would turn into a parking lot that had a dip at the entrance   I had the same problem with the Expedition as well   Since I had that fixed about two months ago I heard the same noise a week ago   had the dealer to check it out   they drove the van and couldn t hear anything   not having good luck getting these problems diagnosed at the dealer   All in all I guess the Windstar is an acceptable vehicle   There are a lot of other vehicles I can think of that I would rather have but it serves the purpose for now  I probably won t buy another when I do get rid of this one   I believe I will be getting another SUV   perferablly GM  Good Luck if you have one or are thinking of purchaseing one  
 Our families have always bought Ford cars and trucks  We have always been treated good until now  My husband and I love this car  We bought this car in October 1999  However  after having the car for a month we were in a car accident  We took the car to be repaired in Dec  1999  Ten weeks after turning in the car in for repair  Ford is still not releasing the parts to repair the car  How can they sell a brand new car but not have the parts available to repair it  This makes no sense to me  We will never buy another FORD again especially after the way we have been treated  Poor customer service br br  
 Besides offering the best value and a solid  stylish  reliable vehicle  the Mazda Tribute offers the widest range and best combinations of options of any small   midsize SUV  If you re most concerned about fuel economy and price  then get the standard 4 cylinder front wheel drive DX  If you want it all decked out  then get the ES V 6 4WD model with leather interior  the deluxe sound package  etc  which was my pick  For everyone else  there are lots of other options in between the bare bones and fully loaded models Even the ES model is still cheaper than almost all the other small SUV s  including its Ford counterpart  the Escape  You might pay a tad less for the Honda CRV  but let s face it the CRV gets uglier every year  and suffers from Honda s trademark problems  no guts  no style  the 2003 2004 model looks like a ladybug  and frequent electrical shorts  The CRV doesn t even have an available V 6  Call me crazy  but I don t think the Japanese automakers who are still trying to run 4WD on 4 cylinders are playing with a full deck  Subaru  Honda  etc  Maybe that s why the Tribute is one of the few Mazda vehicles made in the U S  Granted  there is the DX Tribute with 4WD and only 4 cylinders  but at least Mazda gives you the V6 option Then again  people who are in the market for Hondas usually aren t too concerned with horsepower  So  to compare apples to apples  for those who think Honda builds the safest cars  you might also be interested to know that the Tribute also outperformed the CRV in its crash test safety ratings  the CRV scored lowest among SUVs this year a departure from Honda s typically impressive crash test ratings  while the Tribute got four stars  When it comes to performance  the V6 Tribute also has more horsepower than the V6 Nissan Xterra and runs more smoothly than the Escape  Although the Tribute and Escape have the same engine  Mazda prides itself on smooth shifting and seamless transmission part of what gives Mazda vehicles a more sporty feel than their Ford counterparts  After owning my Tribute for 4 months  I have to say that I have been impressed by the smooth shifting as well as the responsiveness of the steering handling Another aspect of the Tribute that has impressed me is its efficient use of space  This was a significant factor in my decision to buy the Tribute  since at 6 7  I have trouble fitting into a lot of cars yet I didn t want to buy a giant truck or a full size SUV and guzzle gas like nobody s business just to accomodate my height  So  I test drove all kinds of cars  from sedans  to luxury cars  to SUVs  and the Tribute has the most spacious interior in both the front seat  back seat  and cargo area  I can actually sit behind myself  i e  behind the driver with the driver s seat adjusted to the position where I have it when I drive  and still have adequate leg room The only caution I have about the Tribute is that Mazda does not seem to be quite as meticulous in taking care of all the little finishing details as perhaps Toyota  among similarly priced SUVs  or the makers of your more pricey SUVs  Acura  BMW  Mercedes  Lexus  etc  For instance  in my Tribute  there is an annoying buzzing sound that comes from the dash stereo console area that the service people have been unable to duplicate and therefore unable to fix  It doesn t stop anything from functioning  and it s not even there most of the time  but bumpy roads seem to trigger it and it s definitely an annoyance  I wouldn t mention it except that a reviewer for the 2003 model mentioned that he thought there was a slight quality control problem with his Tribute as well  one of the rubber seals on a window wasn t quite properly installed  Again  these are not functional or mechanical problems  but they are definitely an annoyance that you wouldn t expect to deal with on a new car  Could be a pattern  could be nothing  You decide That being said  Mazda stands behind its vehicles more than the competition with its 4 year 50 000 mile warranty  That s a year longer and 14 000 miles further than most  Even if you plan on buying a new car every year or two  it does a lot for the resale value if it s still under warranty  Personally  I plan to drive my Tribute into the ground  and with Mazda s reputation for building long lasting cars  I expect that to take a while  
 I got my Achieva used and I paid a little over  11000 00 to say the least I wasn t to happy until I took it for a test drive around the block  I noticed the power of the 3 1V6 with a little under 200 hp the car had under the hood  Before I finished the drive I knew I wanted this car  The Achieva performs wonderfully  it s very comfortable not to mention it s wonderful handling The passing gear kicks out around 90   95 mph  oh well it s still a great car The only work I ve ever had done was  The brake pads routers  struts  the belt  new brakes  tires  I m always getting the oil changed 1000 miles before it s needed  usual maintenance you should always take care of quot Achieva SL quot  came with daytime running lights for safety  power door locks  windows  anti lock brakes  cruse control  rear defrost and window locks  Anitlock brakes  what I really love is the  quot traction control quot  I use this all the time  LOVE THE Ahcieva I can t think of one bad thing to say about the Achieva  other then I want to get RamAir installed to increase the HP br br  
  My Story b I was in the market for a new vehicle  but I didn t really know what I wanted  I had heard that the Toyota Corolla was a reliable car  so I went to try one of those first Well  I m 6 1  tall  1 85 meters  and I quickly found out that there wasn t nearly enough legroom  and the tilt wheel didn t  tilt  high enough for me  I tried the Camry next  but realized that everyone around here owns a Camry  so I kept it in mind as a last option if I didn t happen to like  or couldn t afford  something else Saturn of Metairie was very close to the Toyota dealer  so I swung by to see what they had available  I thought maybe an SL2 would be nice  but again  it felt too small and cramped for me  My sales consultant took me to the back of the lot to look at the new L Series cars  I fell in love with them immediately  The look was very euro  the L being based on the Opel Vectra  Opel being owned by GM and based in Germany  and I felt it would be a great vehicle for me b The test drive b I test drove both the LS1 and LS2  as they were known at the time   as of the 2001 model year  they were renamed as the L200 and L300  and felt that the 4 cylinder engine in a midsize car was woefully underpowered  It felt as though the parking brake was on whenever I took my foot off the gas  because my speed would drop like a rock  In comparison  the V6 in the LS2 was much more powerful  and I took to it immediately   The purchase b After driving the LS2  I knew I had to have one  It was close to the end of the 2000 model year  so I factory ordered a new 2001 dark blue L300 with ABS traction control side head curtain airbags  and the outline kit  I took delivery on October 3rd  2000 and I m still loving the drive just over a year later b Strengths  L300 b b  Powerful 3 0 liter V6 engine    This car has a spec 182 horsepower  5 600RPM and 190 foot pounds of torque  3 600RPM  but if you re not one to read specs  this car moves  when you tell it to  I ve easily passed 18 wheelers on the interstate with no trouble at all  This car is also immensely fun to drive  even though it s not a stick shift b  Smooth shifts    This car comes standard with a 4 speed automatic transmission and and it s hard to hear or feel the car shift  unless you stomp on the accelerator  If you need passing power  hit the gas  and the car downshifts easily to give you all the power you ll need b  Minimal wind noise    When doing interstate driving  the wind noise isn t very noticeable at all  I don t have to turn up the stereo to drown it out like I have to in our  98 Ford Taurus b  Excellent factory stereo    I believe the Saturn factory stereos are manufactured by Panasonic  and the base setup  AM FM radio  tape deck  CD player  sounds great through the 8 speakers located around the vehicle  I can t comment about the advanced audio option  but it includes a subwoofer  and actually  removes  2 of the speakers in the rear doors b  Polymer panels    A standard Saturn feature  the polymer panels cover most of the car  The roof  hood  trunk  and rear quarter panels are steel  however  When I wash the car  it always looks as good as the first day I took delivery b  Controls laid out well    The center console has everything logically placed  and easy to read  Some people may say the window controls should be on the doors  rather than on either side of the shifter  but it adds a touch of European styling to what I feel is a great car   Besides  I believe that it s a trend in the newer BMWs   b New items included standard with all trim levels  2002 models b    Starting in the 2002 model year  all L Series cars come standard with ABS traction control  side head airbags  emergency trunk handle release  and the L200 and L300 both come standard with 4 wheel disc brakes   The L100 base trim level still has rear drum brakes b  Lower maintenance and insurance costs    If you purchase the Saturn car care package you ll pay about  500 for 3 years 36 000 miles worth of standard maintenance  including oil changes  tire rotation  fluid checks and changes  new windshield wipers  etcetera  This alone will save you quite a bit of money  There s also a longer plan   5 years 60 000 miles  I believe for around  1 200  this amount may differ depending where you live In addition  State Farm insurance has worked with Saturn in the design of their cars  so depending upon your insurer  you can usually get very reasonable premiums  I m with USAA and I thought they made a typo when I received my first bill  b Weaknesses  L300 b b  Fair gas mileage    Realizing that with any larger engine  you ll use more fuel I still feel that the city mileage could be at least 1 or 2 mpg better  In the city  I still tend to get slightly  less  than the EPA estimate of 20 mpg  Highway mileage is usually slightly better than the estimate of 26 mpg  however b  Isn t mated to a manual transmission    This  at first  may not seem like a big deal but I m now in the market for a stick shift  and sadly I may have to trade my car in for a different make  Several Japanese cars are now mating their V6 engines to a stick shift  such as the Toyota Camry Solara  and the Nissan Maxima and Altima  for 2002  The V6 engine in the L300 just  begs  to be mated to a manual transmisson  I hope Saturn seriously reconsiders this for the 2003 model year  when the L Series is supposed to be restyled b  Doesn t come standard with ABS or head curtain airbags  2000 2001 models b    Most cars these days are starting to add these options  but be aware that if you purchase a 2000 2001 model  it may not come with these options   My dealer  for example  didn t stock any cars with ABS in inventory  so that s why I was forced to factory order my car b  Interior could be made of better materials    In general  the interior is nice but it s not as refined as its primary competition   the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord  I realize that my car is only the 2nd model year of the L series  so I hope that they continue to improve the quality  One point I can t overlook  however  is the center console between the seats  where you can store things  This piece unfortunately looks quite cheap  I hope they decide to improve the quality in future designs Also  the interior door handles are basically plastic  but coated to appear chrome  This is a  very  cheap item for the flagship model  it s included in  all  of the L series trim levels as well  Either they should give us chrome door handles  or make them plastic and don t make them  look  chrome  In the 2000 models  they were known to break off as well  if pulled too hard  A service bulletin was issued to replace broken door handles b  Horrible OEM tires    These cars come standard with Firestone Affinity HP tires All I can say is   please  get them changed out as soon as you purchase the vehicle  I had a tire blow out on me on the interstate once  and the tech couldn t find any sign of damage to the tire  He said in the comments section that the tire looked like it just came apart  there was no sign of impact or damage b  Pedals are much too close together    Being a larger car  Saturn should realize that larger people would probably be purchasing these vehicles  but the gas and brake pedals are quite close together  With my big feet  I  still  once in awhile manage to hit both pedals at once b The final analysis b Overall  this is a wonderful car  despite the weaknesses mentioned above  For a price of just over  23 000 including taxes and fees  I was able to purchase a solidly built and much less expensive midsize automobile than most of the Japanese midsize competitors could match  I bring my car in for free  pre paid  service every 3 months with the Saturn car care service  and I know that my car is being well maintained Whether you love haggling with car dealerships  or you can t bear the thought of it  give Saturn a try  You ll be treated with respect and courtesy  and the car is a great value for the money you spend  
 The Acura 3 2 CL Type S  CL S for short  is the kind of car that needs to be driven and compared  so make sure that after reading all about the CL S here on Epinions  you go to your Acura dealer and actually drive one  This is because the car is awesome on paper  but I find that in person it falls short from all the praises that this car gets from the press and their owners  It s often compared to the BMW 330Ci  and yes on paper the CL S looks like the better deal  better performance for a much lower price  but in reality  the BMW is so much superior  Let s take a look b Exterior  This is a matter of personal taste  but I find one word to describe the Acura CL S  Bland  The style is not offensive  it just induces sleep  It screams  I m a Honda Accord Coupe  You re paying more for me just because I have  Acura  written on me  And if you know me  you know I don t like Hondas because well they are so conservatively styled and boring and low quality  But to give it some credit  the back styling is much improved from the previous generation which looked like the car s rear belonged on the front  But still  the flat  slab paneled body sides and the nondescript front fascia are proof that car makers don t care about bold and great styling in their cars anymore   Acura did have some great styling before  look at the NSX and Integra The Sundance Gold color is very striking and eye catching  but a bit odd on an Acura  I like the dark blue  Monterey Blue Pearl  because it s sporty yet classy and appropriate for an Acura  At least Acura doesn t charge extra for metallic paint  unlike most European brands  including BMW The Xenon HID headlights are very bright and unlike on a BMW  they are standard equipment  true for a lot of options  The CL has almost everything standard equipment for which BMW nickels and dimes you b Interior  The interior is much better than an Accord Coupe s  as you d expect  The Type S model comes with perforated leather and white faced gauges which feels a bit out of place in a car that feels to me more of a luxury car than a sports sedan  I feel that the gauges are too  buried  into the dash that doesn t give them the visibility and intimacy that you expect with the information on the gauges that you need when driving fast  But the perforated leather is very nice and the quality of the leather and interior plastic is surprisingly good  It feels like a  50K car inside To me  this car feels very big  one reason why I didn t get it  and I felt  buried  in the car and it was hard to look out and see the end of the hood  The front seats are very comfortable and almost infinitely adjustable  with supportive back and side bolsters  Even so  I couldn t into a driving position that was both comfortable and safe feeling  i e  gave me maximum visiblity  Acura definitely know how to make a luxury car  The rear seats are spacious and comfortable  and will fit two decently sized adults without a problem  You can t squeeze 3 folks back there because there is a little flat center console that makes the rear seats strictly for two people The in dash 6 CD changer is a very nice standard equipment  You insert your CDs one by one through what looks like any ordinary single CD player  but it somehow stores them all in there  The dash controls are very well designed and it has a clean look  like on a BMW  but the temperature controls are a bit too small and they are push button type  because it s an automatic climate control system  I much prefer big dials to control the temperature for ergonomic reasons The Navigation System  which is the only option for this car  is impressive in that you interact with it via a touch screen  rather than with buttons  like on the BMW  This is a step in the right direction in terms of usability of these Navigation Systems  The screen also serves as the on board computer that gives you vital stats about your car The trunk is refreshingly big  compared to the pathetic little space in the 330Ci  You can easily put a big subwoofer box in there and still have room to spare b Visibility  For me  visibility was a problem in this car  The rear windows are hard to see out of while backing up  and because I felt  buried  in the car  I didn t feel too confident driving in this car as I had a hard time looking out in all directions  It felt like I was driving my father s Buick  in more ways than one  see below  The bottom of the window was literally at shoulder height  so you can imagine how uneasy I felt in the driver s seat b Drive  Let s do the BMW 330Ci vs  Acura CL Type S shootout  Finally  getting behind the wheel and on the road  So on paper  the CL has 225hp 217lb ft torque and the Type S  260hp 232lb ft torque  Very impressive   CL wins   The BMW 330Ci pales in comparison  or does it First of all  you cannot get manual transmission on the CL S  There is a manumatic transmission with an open gate  a la Jaguar  shifter  but I just can t get used to  tapping  the shifter to shift gears  And I have a bias against auto shifters being on the floor  I can t stand them   330Ci wins  Second  the CL S is a front wheel drive car while the 330Ci is a rear wheel drive car  Although not as bad as some other cars  there is a bit of torque steer in the CL S  when you floor the gas pedal  the steering wheel tends to  tighten up  which is a characteristic of almost all front wheel drive cars  This may be a strange statement  but the car reminded me a lot of my father s Buick LeSabre  There is power when you ask for it  but there is no soul  The car just responds without complaint or drama or enthusiasm  The BMW  however  sings and wails and loves it when you floor the gas pedal   330Ci wins   I didn t have a chance to drive the car to the limit due to road conditions  but on the turns it felt like the car didn t have any questionable under or oversteer or body lean  Handling was pretty impressive with this car  given it s perceived bigger size  at least to me  compared to the 330Ci  I expected it to wobble like a Buick  but it didn t  So yes indeed  Acura has come a long way in competing with BMW s renowned handling characteristics   It s a tie  Third  this is something that can t really be quantified  but the CL S does not feel as fun to drive as the 330Ci  The fun factor  I didn t see myself wanting to yell  whoo hoo  and grinning from driving the Acura  whereas I was happy as a puppy in the BMW  The BMW just felt more nimble and fun to drive   330Ci wins  b Conclusion  The Acura CL S is a very value oriented  options packed luxury coupe that boasts incredible performance numbers at a sexy price  While its handling is comparable to the BMW 330Ci  it is no where as fun to drive as the BMW and it s major flaws are bland exterior styling  bad visiblity  torque steer  and the lack of manual transmission as an option If I wanted massive horsepower for very little money  there is a thing called Camaro or Mustang  If I wanted a luxurious coupe with some performance  then it s the Acura CL S  But if I wanted a fun sporty coupe with a side order of luxury  it s the BMW 330Ci  not the Acura CL S   But alas  the price difference  you say  Which is why there is a thing called a BMW 325Ci  the car I ultimately chose  So I miss out on cool little options  but I was in the market for a sporty coupe  not a luxury car  so options and gadgets were not top priorities In sum  Acura still makes some of the best  under appreciated  under valued luxury cars for a great price  Lexus and Mercedes Benz and BMW definitely overcharge you  The CL S stays true to the Acura name and delivers the luxury  but it is a long way off from offering a fun  soulful car that it wants to be  
 I was helping my mother buy a car  We looked at several that I thought were perfect for her  The Mitsubishi Galant is very nice  as well the new Nissan Maxima  I spent 2 weeks doing tons of research so I could help her make an intelligent purchase  We looked for cars all day Friday  and then until noon on Saturday when I went bowling  I made her promise me she wouldn t buy a car while I was bowling  When I came out of the alley at about 4pm  there she sat with her shiny new Buick  I was angry  What I had read about this car suggested it had all the technological advantages of a car built in 1982  It was not recommended by any of the car magazines I had used to research  On top of all of that  the initial impression I got of the car was that it looked like something drawn out in a few minutes  and immediately put into production  This car just isn t pretty at all  I didn t like it from the start  but I wasn t going to completely hate it until I had driven it  Two days later a few of my buddies and I were driving to Atlanta  the back seat of my car is a little cramped  so I borrowed our new Buick Century  The first thing I noticed on the inside was how uncomfortable the seats were  I said   quot theres still a chance it drives well  heck the supercharged Regal is a dynamo  and these are very similar cars quot  I pushed the throttle down  Nothing  I tried it again  Still nothing  It took me a few moments to realize that you had to push the gas down  hold it  and wait for the car to do anything  Then I proceeded at a slow pace  Rather later about 13 seconds at my guess when I got the car up to highway speed I noticed that the car vibrates  To me  this is an immediate turn off  All cars should be made to drive at highway speed without vibration  After driving it for a while I began to notice something else that irked me slightly  When you go into a turn  the car sways very badly  It tries to continue on in the direction you were going  The body roll is horrible  The entire weight of the car causes it to sway in turns even in very slow turns  The final insult was the power steering  The closest thing I can compare it to is driving a golf cart  There is no tension at all from the road  You can move the wheel back and forth several inches before the car has any kind of reaction The only bright spot I found with this car is that it does hold four men and these guys were pretty big  and all their stuff rather comfortably To me that s the only reason to buy this car br br  
 Update  12 02  I was involved in another accident and again the car was there to save me  This was also a front impact accident  and after repairs  the car is running great again  Definitely recommend for safety reasons Update  7 01  My Legacy Saved My Life  In a rear end accident just over a year ago  an old man in front of me stopped unexpectedly at an unprotected intersection  My eyes weren t on the road and I plowed into him  crunching my car and deflating my airbags  I was taken to the hospital and discharged a few hours later  I received my car back three weeks later after repairs  Had I not had airbags  I would have plowed through the windshield and had much more severe injuries  And unlike most cars  I haven t had any problems with my Legacy since the accident 02 02  I ve been taking my Legacy to the slopes  The only cars I see in the parking lots are Subaru s  beside the trucks   SUV s  The AWD system is a charm  I feel extremely safe driving in packed snow  slush  and other terrible weather conditions I leased my 2000 Legacy L a month ago   I LOVE MY LEGACY b  I ve already put 3500 miles on it  and it s still running smoothly The biggest factor in my car decision was safety  and this car is supposed to be the safest car this year in its class  It rated the best in crash tests  has air bags  traction control  and anti lock brakes  The amazing part is  the Legacy can help PREVENT accidents from even happening with its unique All Wheel Drive system  Have your Subaru sales person explain it to you it s worth it  for your life Inside the Legacy is like a dream  It s a fun ride and extremely comfortable  My 6 4  friend says it s one of the few back seats he s actually comfortable in  I go for long drives  and I m comfy all the way there and it s a quiet ride compared to most of the cars I ve been in  especially the Toyota Landcruiser  Comfort and quiet are two great pluses Even with soaring gas prices  I go 350 miles on a full tank and it costs me between  20 25 to fill up  The sticker claims about 20 30 gas mileage  which is the minimum recommendation for a commuter I d recommend this car to anyone in a heartbeat   I LOVE MY LEGACY b  
 My husband and I bought a 97 Dodge Intrepid about six months ago  and we absolutely love it  I m the primary driver of it  and the feel is very smooth  The car is fairly quiet  and there s lots of leg room in this car  even in the back seat  I drive this car a lot  since I commute an hour to work and back every day  and I feel very comfortable in it  even when the roads aren t ideal  We have the Sport model  so this car even has an Autostick  This enables you to drive the car as a standard  but without the clutch  Believe me  this is very valuable when the roads are slick   I love being able to slow down the engine without ever touching the brake  Overall  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who wants a dependable car with lots of room  the trunk is huge too  and anyone with a family  There s plenty of room for tall people in it too br br  
 The  99 Mercury Sable is alot of car for not a whole lot of money  With A 7 year old son and a baby on the way  we needed to trade in the old 2 door and get a 4 door  We found what we were looking for in the Mercury Sable  It offers  driver and passenger side air bags  front wheel drive and spacious trunk space  The 6 cylinder fuel injected engine has good acceleration while offering a quiet ride  Our Sable has power windows  power door locks  and power mirrors  The 6 way power seats really help on those long drives especially with the power lumbar support  An AM FM cassette stereo with CD changer controls provides an excellent sound system  The interior has more than adequate leg room for the front and rear passengers  The middle console provides added storage and flips up out of the way  With a 50 mile one way trip to work I would have expected the gas mileage to be better than it is but with that being the only drawback  I am more than pleased with our Sable     
 I bought my Cabrio in July 2000 and have had a very enjoyable experience with the car  I drive it daily year round and it has a bit of pep and handles well in traffic  It really helps my mood to take the long way home through the mountains in the summer with the top down  Speaking of which  the top is of very high quality and keeps the interior fairly quiet on the highway I m 6 2  and the interior head room is adequate and the seats are very comfortable  the GLS heated seats are excellent in the winter  The trunk is surprisingly roomy and holds enough stuff for a weekend camping outing  I ve not sat in the back seat  but two adults are comfortable back there for a short jaunt  The only negatives I can come up with are the brake squeal when it is cold  below freezing  and the clutch  Since the squeal goes away when the brakes warm up and braking performance is very good  I tend to believe the dealer s story that it is the materials in the shoes  Also  I like a short clutch travel and the clutch is a bit long and heavy for my tastes Overall  a great car and I m looking forward to owning it for many more years  
 The best car I ever had was a 1989 Acura Integra RS  automatic transmission  It was quick  responsive  nimble  reliable  utilitarian an all  round great car to own  In September 1999 I was forced to replace it  so I bought an 1999 Acura Integra LS  apparently Acura is making the RS only in very limited quantities  I have two problems with the new model 1  The new Integras are not as fast or responsive as the old ones  I am not at all technical so bear with me  Acura has changed the structure of the gearing drive train on the new models and  while they have more horsepower than the older models  the power is not used as efficiently  Acceleration in the 1999 Integra is sluggish and unpredictable in the low range  I miss the confidence I used to have in the 1989 Integra whenever I needed to pull out onto a busy highway quickly 2  Interior space is cramped  I had a lot more room in the 1989 model  Obviously the airbags take up some space  but the headroom is much lower too  Someone told me it was because of the sunroof   but can you get an Integra without one That said  the Integra is still one of the best deals going  Acura reliability and service is simply outstanding  You might pay more initially for an Acura  but you re getting a car that s built to last  Five years down the road  you ll be glad you bought it     
 We bought a used 1995 Ford Aerostar in 1998  Our initial reason for buying the van was that we have 4 children  2 of which are still in car seats  With a family that size  our options were very limited Initially we were pleased because with the 2 bench seats as well as the 2 front seats  it is a 7 passenger vehicle  which made it roomy enough for our crowd  Even with the 2 car seats  there was still plenty of room for the other 2 older boys to sit comfortably without being squished  And during road trips our boys could get comfortable  lay their head on a pillow positioned over the arm rest and go to sleep while still buckled securely into their seats  Also  since we had the extended cargo area van  there was plenty of room for hauling  whether it was the futon bed we bought for our toddler when it came time for him to move from the crib  or the computer desk  or all our luggage when driving from California to D  C  Roominess was never a problem with this van What was a problem was lousy gas mileage  Another problem was the frequent problems with the front end alignment  It seemed to never stayed aligned  regardless of how excellent a condition the roads were in  Also the van drives very heavily  What I mean by this is that when going around curves or making a turn  it leans on it s side and makes you feel like you are going to tip over  True  this vehicle is built like a tank  and if it did tip over  we d probably be safe  But I m not willing to take that chance  Also  the manuverability for changing lanes  pulling into parking spaces or any of the other simplist driving tasks  is terrible  The simplists tasks become major chores in this van  And the fact that it squeeks and rattles and makes a lot of noise doesn t make matters any better Also  I have to admit that I did not like the air conditioning vents for the back  They did not cool  or heat  the back area of the van very well  Even the children in the bench seat closest to the front of the van were often either not warm enough or not cool enough Also  on the driver s side in the passenger area  there are some controls for the stereo  While this may seem a good idea for some  it was a source of constant annoyance for us  The children loved to play with the buttons and were constantly changing the radio station I can give this van one more bit of praise  For those of you out there that have a large family and are frequently taking road trips  the bench seats in the van can be taken out easily  and rearranged  We had the big bench in front at some points  at other points it was the small bench in front  But the arrangement that we used the most often and was what the children seemed to enjoy the most was when we had the front bench face backwards so that on road trips the children could be buckled in securely  and yet still interact with each other and share toys back and forth And finally  one last warning  During the 1 1 2 yrs we had this van we constantly had mechanical problems with it  Also  since the front end alignment was frequently off  the tires wore down unevenly very quickly and had to be replaced more quickly then they would have been otherwise br br  
 I tested a 92 SC300 in August 1999  I was looking for a quality set of wheels with a serious performance side  Since I have always admired the Lexus SC s beautiful styling  I decided to see if it had what I was looking for  The SC300 I tested had 120k miles on the odometer  and was a 5 speed stick  which is a requirement for me  It was finished in a beautiful dark candy apple red paint that looked gorgeous on it  The interior was pale tan leather with the darker brown plastic accents on the dash  Very tasteful and elegant  Fit and finish on the car were top of the line  The seats were very comfortable  and the driving position was excellent  After I sat down and acquainted myself with the controls  I found my first disappointment  The plastic materials used around the dashboard area and the controls look high quality  but feel cheaper than they look  When tapped  the plastics sounded like they were made of a thin  brittle material  The center console armrest was made out of hard  brittle plastic  instead of the soft touch plastic you might expect for an armrest  Interior room was fine up front  but very limited in back  Only children would fit in the rear seats  Cargo capacity is limited by the shallow trunk storage area  I didn t try the stereo  so I can t comment on it So I started the car up and took it for a drive  Here is where I met my biggest disappointment  Although the SC looks like a performance vehicle from its styling  it does not deliver in its driving experience  The 5 speed stick shift was very notchy and had excessively long throws  The power output from the engine felt lethargic at all RPMs  The brakes were slow to respond  The steering felt disconnected from the road  The body leaned excessively in corners  Despite the fact that the SC is rear wheel drive  the cornering balance was heavy understeer at all times  This car is clearly not intended for any sporty driving  period  My final verdict  while the SC300 has the body of a real looker  it is actually a couch potato in disguise  Pass this one by if you value fun in your driving experience br br  
 After several MB s  two different sets of Jaguars  yes  one to drive and one to leave at the shop  Audis  mine never self propelled  and other brands too numerous to mention  both foreign and domestic  I have to admit I ve never had more fun or comfort that I get from my 1999 Expedition4Wd Eddie Bauer I d like it even more if the dealer could fix the AWD  which  when activated  manages to blink the  quot AWD ON quot  indicator like a turn signal  but what the heck  I ve still got 4WD Hi and Lo  so I m not really upset despite the 4 unsuccessful tries  now they say they have the right parts in stock and will repair it next time I drop by for routine service At 28 000 miles the car  truck  looks and drives like it did when it was brand new  That means  among other things  it still gets 12 mpg  And I still scrunch down in my seat when I m in indoor parking garages because the combined extra height from the 17 inch wheels and the roof rack produces a nerve jarring 6 7 quot  profile that some day may become a convertible when one of those overhead garage beams is a few inches lower than the sign at the entrance says it is  clearance on my at home garage door frame is about two inches   phew  Recommended accessory   a third seat prop bar that lets you leave the seat in while propping it up to reclaim stowage space  For  49 95 you can get one at http www knoxx com Good sound system  nice leather  good trimwork and  overall  a very comfortable ride in town and on the freeway  It s almost enough to make you believe that when Ford claims  quot Quality is job  1 quot  they mean it br br  
 Getting an F150 was the best decision I have made transportation wise in 3 years  I bought this truck because my Explorer was not big enough and strong enough suspension wise to carry the things I need to work  I got the 4 2L V6  which I have found to be more than adequate for my needs and it is powerful enough for hauling and still accelerating briskly  The automatic transmission shifts firmly and is responsive  I wish that they would offer the 5 speed automatic that I had in my Explorer though  The ride is every bit as nice as any car I have driven  It doesn t deteriorate with a full load either and believe me I have hauled some heavy loads of pallets of ceramic tile  The handling is firm and the steering is responsive  The interior comfort is great with the XLT package  I like the ability of being able to turn off the passenger side airbag since I have a 7 year old son  The back seat is roomy and comfortable my son loves it  He especially likes to open the pop out back windows  The 4 doors are a convenience  especially when you have groceries or extra toolboxes to carry and unload  I have taken 2 long trips in it  I have to admit that I am less tired and sore after driving this truck than any car I have owned  All the controls are within easy reach  There is a convenient power port for recharging my phone where the ash tray is and you don t have to remove the lighter  It has more cupholders than my parent s Lincoln Mark VIII  My mom was jealous  I also opted for a camper shell  since I can leave stuff in the bed and lock it this way  There is so much room that my wife was able to sleep during our trips very comfortably in the front seat  The quality control is excellent  I have put over 10 000 miles on it and the only problem that I have had is the aftermarket CD changer had to be replaced  I can t think of anything that I dislike or hate about this truck  The mileage isn t great about 20 on the highway  It seems to me now that almost any family could get use out of a truck like this  It seems that there is always something that we may get for home improvements  or furniture or something where you find yourself wondering how you ever got anything done without one  The money saved in delivery charges alone may make a few months of the payments  Plus  the four doors make it applicable as a family hauler  You don t have to leave the kids at home when you need to carry something big  Ok  I have to add to my review now after 20000 miles on this truck  I just returned from a 1200 mile trip and averaged 22 miles per gallon  This thing will go from Houston to Amarillo on a tank and a half  This is also the only vehicle that I have ever had that I have not had to have some type of warranty work done on it  The quality is just that good br br  
 I am not first in line to bash American vehicles and I am also not a Ford disciple  which means I am able to remain objective about this car  My feeling is that this isn t that bad of a car  yet not great  I purchased my Taurus GL used in 2001 with 70K miles and it now is at 130K There are a few things that bother me about the car  but the transmission has always been my greatest concern  Not long after I purchased the car there was a strange hiccup while driving that seemed to happen after longer trips  I never determined what caused it although it hasn t happened for a long time  It could actually have been the brakes which I replaced  although it felt like it was in the transmission  More recently  I had a very strange problem with my transmission which started with alternator and power steering problems  Both would malfunction while driving  which later I found was caused by some kind of transmission sensor module  I later found out that if you don t fix it immediately  it really messes up your overdrive  which is what I am experiencing now I would say the other problems with the car are more annoying than major  The interior lights have a tendency to stay on after you shut the door  which I solved by pulling out the bulbs  The interior in my car is cheap and the rear window is hard to clean because of its oddball shape  Also on a more personal note  the person who owned the car prior to me burned holes in the interior and stunk up the car with their smoking habit  I still cannot get all of the smell out  which annoys me  On the good side  the V 6  3 0 liter Ford standby has been a good performer I used semi synthetic oil in it  which may or may not help  If not for the transmission I would be more than happy with the car  adding that Scosche sells kits for getting rid of the stupid stereo console  It is what many people call a  grandpa car  but if you are not vain about those things it is not a bad car  If you are mindful of the transmission problems and take steps to prevent the problems  it could be a good deal used  
 My boyfriend has owned a  95 Ford Escort LX Wagon for almost two years now and it hasn t had any problems  When you see a Escort Wagon they re usually bought as business cars  ie Ikon  or family cars  There are many reasons for this  they re dependability and they re comfort  His car already has 185 000 miles on it  from road trips to Santa Cruz  and San Francisco  a lot of free way driving  but a lot of city wear too  Of the two years and probably 85 000 miles he put on it himself  there hasn t been a single problem  Giving it regular oil changes  and tune ups is the only expense you really have  You get about 25 mpg city and 30 freeway  The only problem with these cars  if you want to consider it a problem  is you can tell when it needs a service job  Like some cars that  quot try to let you know quot  when they need service by breaking down  this one gets a little little sluggish  as if to say  quot Ok  oil change please quot  or  quot Give me a tune up quot  If you re planning on buying your teen a car  or yourself  and don t have the money to spend loads on timing belts  radiators etc  This is the car to choose br br  
 I bought an F 150 because it was the first full size truck I found which had what I needed  extended cab and 5 speed  just try to find a Chevy or Dodge with THAT combo  So I really wasn t brand loyal What I like  1  Ride  almost too soft my my tastes 2  Power  plenty enough for doing whatever is necessary  like carrying eight 200lb railroad ties 3  Transmission  good shift quality from the Mazda built 5 speed 4  Seats  very comfortable 5  Parts  cheap to repair  easy to service 6  Mileage  18 22mpg 7  Handling  takes corners at a much higher speed than a vehicle of this size should 8  No rattles  squeaks  or other wierd noises What I don t like 1  Paint on hood is easily chipped 2     
 This has to be one of the best small trucks of all time  This was the very first vehicle I bought on my own  so maybe I am prejudice  But I absolutely loved it  It was just the right size for me  When I went car shopping  I knew I wanted a truck  But I wasn t sure what kind  I tried all of them out and this was the only one short enough for my legs   I m 5 3 quot  It was strong and sturdy enough to tow and do what I needed it to  It was also a true joy to drive My truck was a standard and a pretty basic package  It did have cruise and a nice radio  but nothing fancy  I had a wreck in it once  The airbag did some damage  but that was about he extent of it  If I had been in a car or another truck  the police officers and paramedics said it would have been much worse When I took the truck to the shop to be repaired  I knew it would never be the same  But much to my surprise  it was good as new  Now that could have been the body shop  But I prefer to think it was the truck itself The only drawbacks to this truck are the cab size and the gas mileage  I had one child when I bought this truck  and that s about all that will fit one child and one adult  Also the gas mileage was about 18 to the gallon  But other than that I just loved it  Great buy br br  
 I own a 1998 Lincoln Navigator and have for about 20 months  I love the vehicle and have had ZERO problems with it  It is roomy and rugged  yet very luxurious and has very nimble handling for such a large vehicle  I have owned about 10 vehicles over my life and this is without doubt the best one I have owned to date  Mileage is about 13 5 miles per gallon highway  about 11 5 miles per gallon city  Handling is great  both on and off the road  Four wheel drive switching is trivial  you can run AWD  all wheel drive  all the time  or switch to 2 wheel  four wheel high  or four wheel low via a dial on the dashboard Interior climate controls are EXCELLENT  I stay cool in summer and warm in winter  and the internal temperature can be set to any desired degree setting from 65 to 85 F  If I must find one thing wrong it would be that the engine in the 1998 model is slightly underpowered  but the 1999 and 2000 models have bigger block engines than the 1998 model so this flaw has been corrected  The Navigator is a very well thought out and constructed vehicle  and I highly recommend it br br  
 After doing a lot of research  I bought my 1994 Celica GT new in the summer of 1994  It stood head and shoulders above the other vehicles I was considering  The price was a little higher than its competitors  but I knew it would hold its value much longer and would be well worth the price I have owned this car for six years now  and I still get compliments from people asking if I have a new car  I have put nearly 100 000 miles on it and have no intentions of trading it in for a very long time  I have had no major mechanical problems other than a bum CD player that was replaced under warranty What a technically sound vehicle  I got all the  quot bells and whistles quot  on my vehicle  and it has run smoothly without a hitch  I ve yet to need a tune up or clutch work done  Of course  regular maintenance helps  but it runs like a champ and has since the day I drove it home  The paint has held up remarkably well and shines like new after a good waxing  The ride is a little loud  but that s part of driving a sporty car  It gets good gas mileage  it s a 5 speed  It has a very roomy trunk for its size I had a hard time getting the car originally because of misrepresentations by the Toyota sales staff  I specified all the options I wanted on my dream car  The sales staff told me they would  quot place an order quot  and that it would arrive in a matter of weeks  After several weeks  I was told that it was on a barge due to arrive in Jacksonville within the week with my car  Again  I waited for several more weeks  After many phone calls  I finally reached someone at Toyota s national level  I was told by him that Toyota doesn t place orders  they just try to match your wishes with what comes off the assembly line in Japan  When I took this information to the local dealer  they apologized for misleading me and gave me my deposit back  I purchased a car from another dealership under AAA s buying plan and had no problem  The only difference between my dream car and the one I purchased was the exterior color I had some problems with the service department  too  The service department took a long time to finally replace my CD player that didn t work correctly  They removed the original one and kept replacing it with rebuilt ones that didn t work either  Once they finally gave me a brand new one  it worked perfectly and is still working great today  The other service problems I had dealt with the warranty work  Sometimes  while doing my routine warranty work  they would change my oil or wash the car and then try to charge me  even though I had not requested it to be done But the car itself is stylish  reliable  and will last me at least another 100 000 miles  I m sure  I guarantee you  my next car will be another Toyota Celica br br  
 I ve owned several different makes of cars in my lifetime  a used Dodge Colt  a new Ford Fairmont  a used Toyota Corolla  a used Nissan Sentra  and a new Nissan Sentra GXE  But  none of them has compared in reliability  and fun  as the new Toyota Paseo I bought in 1996  All of my previous cars had trouble  practically from day one  With the two new ones I bought  trouble started within one year  My supposedly  nice new Sentra GXE  fully loaded  had electrical problems galore  So much so that I was afraid to drive it anymore for fear that I might be locked inside someday  I never intended to buy the Paseo  I went in for the sole purpose of trading in my Sentra GXE for a reliable  cheaper model of car  When I saw that Paseo sitting on the showroom floor  it was love at first site  To be brutally honest  the first thing that attracted me to the Paseo was the looks  Secondly  I checked to see that there were no electric windows  locks  cruise control  etc  I didn t necessarily have to check its track record as I ve known that Toyotas are good cars  that s why I wanted one  Since 1996  I ve taken my Paseo in for its routine  quot check ups quot  as prescribed under warranty  The only things that have been performed at this date  12 99  is your basic oil filter changes  rotation of tires  and routine checks to make sure  quot all systems are go quot  My  quot toy quot  is the greatest to zip around in  that is if you like zipping around in a sporty looking  5 speed car  The sound system is great  the ride is comfortable  maybe not for back seat drivers   a little short on leg room back there  all controls are accessible  and it has two front airbags for safety  And  on top of all that  even at nearly four years old  it still draws attention  it doesn t have that boxy  rear end look of previous Paseos  Of all the cars I ve owned  the Toyota Paseo is the only car that I want to keep forever  Who knows  maybe someday it will be a  quot classic quot br br  
 I was given this car as a company vehicle when I first arrived in the US 2 months ago  My first thought on seeing it was  what an ugly heap  I was more impressed by the luggage space as it fairly easily swallowed all of the stuff a family of 4 carry when travelling to a new land Driving from the airport to the hotel I was immediately struck by how soft the seats were  Almost sofa like in comfort if you only travel for a few miles  Problem is that for longer journeys they are completely lacking in support and I was in agony after only 50 miles or so Next nuisance item was the multifunction stalk for controlling lights  wipers etc  Really  these functions should be seperated but the use of a column gear change prevents that  These column mounted gear stalks are very quaint  but personally if I never see one again it will be too soon Performance was  well how could I put this without cussing  absolutely useless  That thing couldn t pull the skin off a rice pudding  It is flatter than roadkill and only slightly more attractive  I don t know its top speed as I never felt sufficiently in control to test it  It felt like it would have trouble outrunning a moped but I never had the courage to try it Brakes are adequate without being startling  I did find that parking brake to be hopeless  Anybody living in a hilly area is going to become rapidly hacked off with not having a normal handbrake rather than the stupid foot operated system  It is impossible to gradually release a foot system so making fully controllable getaways a distant dream Handling  Handling  Nope  not on this thing  This is the sort of softly suspended barge on wheels American cars used to be like  This might have been acceptable in 1975  but things have moved on a long way since then  My last 3 cars were 2 SAABs and an Audi A4 so perhaps criticising the handling is a little unfair  Problem is that Ford s offering in this category in Europe is the Mondeo and it kicks bottom  Now that is a car they should be offering to the American public  rather than the shoddy heap of garbage that is the Taurus  
 I have been in love with this car ever since its inception in 2000  I don t even like convertibles but it still holds my heart  It it THAT good  With this car Honda has captured the true meaning of sports car  High power  low weight  everything planned out to the greatest extent  As it was just revised for 2004 I will comment on the differences of this car as I go You already know that it s beautiful  I will tell you that its ergonomics are very well laid out and comfy  Fit and finish are superb  For 2004 we get some nice subtle styling updates  My favorite is that the cabin is a little roomier due to deeper sculpted doors  This is a very nice touch as I drove a 2002 and a 2004 back to back and really appreciated the added elbow room  The rest of the changes I m sure you can find elsewhere so I won t list them What we really care about this car is how it performs  Vroom vroom  The S2000 is no compromise car  It extremely stiff and it is loud on the freeway  The 2004 is supposed to ride quieter but I felt their noise levels were the same  The 2004 has notably softer suspension though  Still sporty  just the pre 2004 cars have rock solid suspension like nothing factory I have ever driven  I do find its leather clad seats extremely comfy and supportive  To further support their ideals that this should be a pure sports car Honda didn t feel the need to come out with a watered down automatic version  It is a six speed or nothing  Don t be fooled that sixth gear will be a nice cruising gear  unless of course you consider cruising at 4 500 rpm at 80 mph relaxing  This gearbox was meant for the track  to keep you right in the powerband  Which  by the way is the best thing about this car Life in the S2000 begins at 6 000 rpm  regardless of year  This is when the VTEC kicks into gear  For the uninitiated basically where most engines would give up this one switches to monster mode which gives you another 2 000 rpm to play with  When this kicks in you will notice a slight and sudden increase in acceleration  The exhaust note changes slightly and you will be amazed as the car rockets off getting faster and faster with building rpm  and increasing pulse  as the beautiful digital tach sweeps across the dash toward its 8 000 rpm redline  This car goes from zero to illegal in about six seconds  One point of difference between the pre and post 2004 cars is the new cars come with a 2 2l engine  old 2 0l  that produces more low end torque than previously  The old engine has 3 000 rpm of VTEC fun to play with and thus has a bit higher redline than the new  While they both produce 240 hp the new one does it at 800 rpm less than the old  I had the chance to drive a 2003 S2000 at a racetrack and can say it is nice to have a wider VTEC range to be able to stay there no matter what  In the new car I felt as soon as I entered that range I had to shift out too soon  If you don t plan to track your car  if you own this car I highly suggest doing this at least once  both of these engines are equally impressive  I did notice that the 2004 has a little extra torque  but it is not really anything to brag about  The whole fun of this car anyway is to drop it a couple of gears and scream off whilst nobody can keep up Equally if not more important to the engine is the cars handling and balance  This car is a front mid engined car  Its mass is centralized for better turning and it has 51  of its weight on the rear tires  It is a common misconception that 50 50 is the ultimate weight distribution  Formula cars are actually more like 60  weight on the rear tires  The S2000 is about the closest you will get to this save the NSX or Lotus Elise  It is a very well balanced car  The S2000 I drove at the track reminded me much of my 1995 Toyota MR2 in the handling department  It is easily throttle steered  if you know what you are doing  Heel toe action is very well set up  Coming out of a corner just squeeze on the throttle and the car just hugs the pavement until you actually start to scare yourself  Then it sticks some more  When you need to stop this car does so with serious authority  To get the most out of this car take it to a local autocross or driving school and learn what it can do  Not doing this could actually be dangerous as this car can spin out on the uninitiated  For 2004 the suspension was set up to be less sensitive to bumps upsetting the car during a corner and to give the driver more warning before a spin  I would say for most people this is a good thing  For the die hard racers they may  I do  prefer the more aggressive old setup Another item to mention is shifting  I have never felt such a short throw  And of course in true Honda style shifting is very precise and it is never hard to get in a gear There have been many complaints because the new car s steering is less sensitive than the old  I found this complaint unfounded  I think people read too much into numbers and should worry more about the feel of the car  I equally like the different steering ratios of the pre and post 2004 cars  The newly updated car is being treated by some as a totally new car which is very untrue  I have had time behind the wheel of both and can say that this is just the evolution of a good thing  The differences are detail and in my book every S2000 gets five stars SO  now that you know  go buy one  
 Very few people know what a great find the Acura TL really is  When you put the TL up against just about every other entry luxury vehicle  there is no comparison We just placed our order for our new 2000 TL after researching so many other vehicles and test driving too many to count  We went into the process thinking that we wanted the Lexus ES 300   after all  it s an extremely luxurious vehicle with a fantastic ride  However  after stumbling upon the TL  we quickly changed our mind  For one thing  everything on the TL is standard  the only option is their Navigation System    things like heated seats  heated mirrors  moonroof  leather seats  CD player  sequential sports shift   everything is included in the MSRP  What you see is what you get  Also  the ride of the TL is better than the ES 300  It s a five speed automatic  vs  4 speed for the Lexus  with undetectible shifting  you can t feel a thing  The TL has the most horsepower in its class  225  with more headroom  legroom  and cargo space than most of its competition  And the best part  You get a better vehicle with better options and a better ride for less money  The TL is by far the best value in its class coming in around  2 000 less than its closest competitor  this is not including the Navigation System So few people know about this car  It s actually kind of nice   you don t see a lot of them on the road  yet I highly recommend the 2000 Acura TL if you re shopping in the entry luxury segment  There isn t a better buy out there Note  If you don t believe me  check out the automotive press  Last month s Car  amp  Driver issue found the TL to be superior to eight of its closest competitors  And I haven t read one thing that contradicts this yet br br  
 I own a 1993 Crown Victoria LX with a performance and handling package  It is the perfect compromise between a sports car and a luxury sedan wrapped in one  not to mention it was fairly affordable  This car currently has 99 000 miles on it and I take immpecable care of my vehicles  As you know  it is equipped with the dependable 4 6 V8  I also have a 1992 Town Car with the same motor with 119 000 miles and very happy with both  Only one problem  At approximatley 90 000 miles on almost every 91 to 97 Ford passenger vehicle with the 4 6  that I have seen it burns oil terribly after the car takes off after idling for a short period of time  I assume this is valve guide seals and NOT bad rings  I have called my local Lincoln and Ford dealer to see if they have had a 4 6 apart for that same reason  They said they haven t  I find this hard to believe  This problem gets worse especially when you approach the 120 000 mile mark  I only hope the remedy is to replace the valve guide seals to probably some tune of  800 and not a complete rebuild upwards of  2800  Both of these cars run beautifully but the oil problem is becoming a nuiscance and embarrasment  especially if your car looks like it has 30 000 miles instead of 230 000  It would be okay to assume one should expect this motor to be pretty much trouble free for 200 000 miles with regular oil changes shouldn t it If you have this same problem or know a solution please let me know Thanks  RB1     
 I bought my gold 240SX new in 1995  for what I still consider to be a great price  Since then  every time I get into the car  I still get a little thrill  I love the low seating with my butt close to the ground  the looks from other drivers the car still gets even after over six years  and the knowledge that it will start right up  every time I turn the key  even at 102 000 miles As the car gets older  I know I ll have to begin putting some money into it  The struts need to be replaced  because on cold days the front end hits the ground at bumps  The timing chains  yep  there are two  will probably need to be replaced  and I m not sure about the clutch  After doing some research on these parts  unless you ve got some illicit source for parts  it s going to cost some money  But I can t complain   I ve had plenty of trouble free years I do not have any issues with rust  but 240SX brakes are notorious  The original front rotors tend to warp  and I had to replace them  But when they work  they work great  The car handles very well  even with 15 inch tires  I have the base model  not the SE  which came with 16 inch wheels  The engine runs smoothly  albeit a bit noisily  acceleration is still good  and gas mileage averages around 24 to 25 miles per gallon  city  Also  with rear wheel drive  you have the standard handling issues in wet and icy conditions  But here in Atlanta  that s not a really big concern for me We are thinking of a family soon  so I expect to have the car only another two to three years  By that time  I will probably have over 140 000 miles on the car  and the history of the car says they will be reliable  and fun  miles  So anyone who is looking at buying this car used  since they stopped making them after the 98 model year  you have my whole hearted recommendation and support  
 My first car was a BMW 2002 given to me by my parents as a high school graduation gift  When I started college sadly I realized that maintaining my pride and joy was way out of my financial ballpark  My parents recommended that I go and take a look at a GOLF  Kicking and screaming they got me there and I took my first test drive in a car that to me was really a big step down  Well with not too many options since my parents were helping me out with the financing  I drove home that same day in my  quot NEW quot  used 1986 VW GOLF  For weeks I complained about everything and anything about this poor innocent car  EVEN THOUGH TO MY DISMAY THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT  IN FACT I EVEN STARTED TO ACTUALLY LIKE THIS CAR REALLY LOVE IT  AND SO BEGAN MY LOVE OF THE VW GOLF I AM NOW ON MY SECOND GOLF A 1994 AND I REALLY CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT MY GOLF  IT HAS NEVER FAILED ME  IT HAS BEEN MORE FAITHFUL THAN ANY MAN I HAVE EVER KNOWN  I LOVE THE FACT THAT I FEEL LIKE I AM DRIVING AN EXPENSIVE LUXURIOUS EUROPEAN SPORTS CAR AT LITERALLY HALF THE PRICE  I LOVE THE HANDLING  THE STEERING IS TIGHTER THAN MY FAVORITE OLD JEANS  IT HUGS THE CURVES EQUALLY AS WELL   THE ONLY BUMMER I HAVE GOTTEN FROM THIS CAR IS WHEN THE AIR CONDITIONING WENT  OTHER THAN THAT TRUTHFULLY I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE 6 YEARS THAT I HAVE OWNED AND LOVED MY CAR  ANOTHER THING THAT I REALLY LOVE IS HOW SPACIOUS THE INTERIOR IS EVEN FOR A SUBCOMPACT CAR  THE BACK SEAT FOLDS RIGHT DOWN AND YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW MUCH STUFF YOU CAN FIT BACK THERE  I HAVE MOVED MYSELF AND MANY FRIENDS AND IT IS UNBELIEVABLE HOW SPACIOUS IT REALLY IS IF YOU LOVE DRIVING  LIKE I DO  AND YOU REALLY WANT THE BEST DEAL FOR THE MONEY BUY A GOLF YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED  I WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMEND THIS CAR TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO ASKS ME     
 I love Escorts  I think they re great I owned this European 1 6 S model for about 6 months and had a few problems The main problem in mine was the fuse box  Its a really common problem and was why the escort was considered unreliable I know enough about cars to change it myself  but it took a long time and a scrap box cost me  30  45  This may not be too much but if you got the Ford dealer to do it for you  it would cost  200   labour  You would be looking at over  400  600 Each escort model has a different fuse box  so finding the correct scrap one was hard The other problem with Escorts is the locks and alarm system  The barrels wear out very easily although if you know how to dismantle a door panel and remove the lock  the dealer only charges a small amount to change the barrels for you  The alarm is another problem  on other European Fords as well  If you lock the door from the passenger side and then unlock the door from the driver side  the alarm will go off  It is caused by a faulty electrical part on either the drivers or passenger side door locks  or both  It can be fixed but the parts will probably break again  Check this if you are buying one and use it to knock the price down Also check ALL electrics  Check the heater  inside fan  engine fan  and electric windows and anything else you can think of  I would not recommend buying a GHIA model or high spec model with a lot of electric parts  as there is to much room for error The main fuse blew on several occasions Other than this  i found the car nice to look at  nice do drive  and the handling was good as well  Seats were a little uncomfortable on long journeys though  Mechanically they are actually very good and the engine problems that occured were purely electricaly related Check the exhaust for rust on the back box though as they do not last very long The engine was the same model as the ones used previously in the 1984 91 model and so are not advanced and can be very noisy if worn  Listen to the tappets  If they are very noisy and the car claims to have done 30 000 miles  then it is more likely to be 130 000 The noises can start from 60 000 miles onwards depending on use  People try crafty methods such as using thick oil  or if the oil is not clean  then this will also dampen the noise  find out what oil was used Don t be put off by this  If the car is clean with a full history  and is quiet ish  then if the price is right  buy it  All electrical problems can be fixed very cheaply if you do it by yourself  You may never even experience any problems  but be aware of them and carry spare main and regular fuses at all time Conclusion Popular car and good value for money  Cheap spares availiable  never go to the dealers br br  
 I currently own a 1996 Geo now Chevy Tracker  My model is a soft top 4X4  The first thing I did when I bought this vehicle was have an alarm system installed  I had previously owned a Tracker that had the soft top cut open  I highly recommend an alarm system  because of this  Otherwise I love this vehicle  It handles well  and is fairly comfortable to drive  I would not recommend that you buy this vehicle if you want a very smooth ride  I think they designed it to  quot feel quot  like a 4 wheel drive  Something that I personally like  Another downside is the trunk space  There basically is no trunk in this vehicle  If space is something that you are looking for this vehicle won t provide it  Gas mileage is fairly good  I don t know the exact numbers  The gas tank is very small  I think it only holds about 8 9 gallons  maybe 10  I do have to fill up quite often  This is a great play car  I use it also to commute  It makes a great second family car  or a great starter vehicle for students  Usually very affordable  I purchased mine earlier this year for about  6 900     
 My husband always shied away from the Lincoln Continental thinking it wasn t as roomy as the larger sized lincolns  He was proved wrong by the new 92 continental he just purchased  It s roomy interior seats 6 comfortably or one large size man  It has all the toys of the higher priced luxury cars but a much lower price tag  It drives great and handles like a baby  In fact  the only complaint is how low it is to the ground  But you feel like you re riding on air  none the less  It s sleek appearance just enhances it s overall appeal  I highly recommend this choice for luxury br br  
 It seems the auto industry goes through certain crazes  With fuel costing 4 times as little as it does in Europe  its no surprise that we have too many mindlessly huge SUV s roaming free in the market  How many Explorer buyers actually need that behemoth  Lets not even get into the Suburban county  Lincoln Navigator  completely loaded with everything you can possibly want in a luxury SUV  costs over 100 000  in certain countries  And a tank full of gasoline is worth around 100  per shot  4 trips to Exxon per month and you just spent the entire monthly salary of an average middle eastern  Yet  the rich go for the American cars because it makes them look rich  It s an expression of excess  but what pulls us to humongous SUV s in the US  Are we all midgets with dreams of being giants  Or just true born off roaders  I can t answer these questions  but we do have the wider roads and the cheaper gas  Nevertheless  we are being shown the other side of the coin   with new SUV s such as Aztek and Xterra  we now have the ability to buy a car that is large enough for skiing trips but not quite the behemoth the larger SUV s are  The resultant cars are what I categorize to be  sensible SUV s  They are not off roaders  and they haven t been built in order to pull an entire college dormitory room  They are just big enough to accommodate extra curricular activities such as surfing  and skiing  Therefore  looking at Ford Escape  one doesn t quite go and say   oh no  not another SUV  There has been much media around this car long before it even was produced  With many other newly introduced mini SUV s such as Xterra and Aztek  Ford obviously wanted people to consider what would enter the scene later   and I believe it was more than worth the wait for those who wanted to test this car before weighting their other options  Offered as either an XLT or an XLS model  Escape comes with either the 4cyl engine from their new Focus  or the larger V6 from the Taurus  I simply don t think the 4cyl engine has enough power to accommodate a smooth ride with more than average cargo  but the V6 definitely can kick some dirt  Well  asphalt dirt that is  simply because this car weighs around 3 5k lbs  and even 200HP SOHC with 200lbs ft of torque doesn t make it adequate for serious off roading  Where you really going to off road  though  However  bad wheat her conditions are definitely manageable due to the 4WD system that is optional on XLT and standard on XLS  The car uses a mechanism with 2 available options   you can either turn 4WD on or leave it on automatic  Ford calls this Control Trac II  While on automatic  the car is FWD unless a computer is warned by slippage on the rear wheels  When this warning occurs  the car automatically engages 4WD for better control  This is pretty neat  and it does save on the fuel  Talking about fuel  one quality that makes this SUV more than a welcome family car is the fact that it has 20 24MPH city highway fuel economy  So  no more negative critique from environmentalists  and nobody can call you nature killer gt The goods for this car are too many to count  and it s also an ideal car for youngsters due to its incredible affordability  With the base price on XLS around 18k on the FWD  and 19 5k on the 4WD  Escape is one of the most affordable SUV s in the market  However  having a monkey appetite can change that easily  There are many options available for both models  and they can both raise the price to somewhere near 30k  We don t want that  but Ford has made a very smart move by separating each option instead of putting everything into something as ridiculous as an  premium package   Mitsubishi did this with the Eclipse  You can get a V6 4WD  with the following minimum options  auto tranny  ABS  and side air bags  Forget about the leather interior jumbo   leave that alone until you can afford a Navigator  With these options  I think you can have one of the best sensible SUV s in the market br br  
 I ve been driving my Neon for about a year  and it has not given me that many problems  It s easy to handle and its small size is very easy for an inexperienced driver to handle  I think that it is the perfect car for a teenager and even though it is not the fastest car  it has a decent acceleration  It has a cute look to it  and runs smoothly also  Even though it is a compact car  it is still very roomy inside and you can fit three or four people in the backseat The car is very gas efficient  and one full tank  that isn t even that expensive  can last me for as long as up to two weeks  I would definitely recommend this car  it is a good all around vehicle for a beginning driver br br  
 Every Saturday night when I roll out in my green Saturn I know I m stylin  The car was a pleasure to buy because at Saturn there s no haggling which also means no preferential treatment for those on the inside loop  I got a CD player  leather seats  a sunroof and other amenities for a decent price  This is my first car and I couldn t be happier  Additionally  as a college student with little money  the car gets great gas mileage  It holds all my friends even though it is a bit small on the inside for taller folks  I added a spoiler to the back of the car for a suped up look  Maintenance has been phenomenal and believe me  stuff has broken down br br  
  General  I ve always been a  four wheels and an engine  kind of guy  you know   point A to point B  I m not into  30 000  vehicles  in fact  I ve never paid more then  12 000 for any vehicle I ve ever owned  I feel that a vehicle is the worst possible investment a person could possibly make  In fact  vehicles are right up there in the ranks of worst investments along with penny stocks and Arizona Beachfront Property b My Entourage  One thing is evident though  you need one to get where you re going  unless you live in the city and use public transportation  I ve owned a few  junkers  in my time  in fact  I have one right now that I use to commute back and forth to work in  It s an  86 AMC Renault Alliance that gets close to 40 miles to the gallon and only has 29 000 original miles on it  for real  I found out it was an elderly lady that owned it previously  she was the one and only owner of the car as well  Everyone makes fun of it  but you know what  it gets me back forth to work at minimum cost and I m not putting unwanted miles on my Explorer b Started to stray  sorry  back to the subject  Anyway  back to the Explorer  I have the 1995 Eddie Bauer edition Explorer  I just bought it a few weeks ago and it had 74 000 miles on it  I got both the Renault and the Explorer from a private dealership in Stannards  NY for  11 500  The previous owner was the original owner  just like the Renualt b PROS b Very  very comfortable  leather seats and power everything CD changer  sunroof  AC  tilt  cruise  system monitor Front and rear climate control Very roomy  rear seats fold down for extra cargo space Rides like a dream  very smooth ride Luggage rack  class III towing package 4WD high auto low b CONS b Not very efficient on gas  I get around 15 miles gallon Sluggish on hills  especially while towing a trailer I expected more from the 4 0L V6 Roll overs possible  from what I ve read about this SUV b Looking Forward  As you can see  I haven t owned this vehicle very long  therefore there isn t much to the CONS list  I m sure that after a few months I ll have more to report on both lists  I ll be sure to update this Epinion at that time  As far as the gas mileage goes  I really haven t owned a large vehicle before  so for all I know  15 miles gallon might be okay b Final Recommendations  All in all  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone  as long as you know the vehicle has been taken care of  I know that the used car thing is not for everyone  I d prefer to pay a little less to get a decent vehicle that has some mileage on it  but I know not everyone thinks the same way  so be sure your comfortable buying something that is used Also  I d like to recommend Dave s Auto Center to anyone that is in the area  Stannards is just south of Wellsville  NY  east of Olean  NY or west of Elmira  NY  Dave is an honest car dealer  yes  I actually used the words  honest  and  car dealer  in the same sentence  this was not a mistake  He was up front about everything about both vehicles I bought from him Dave s Auto Center is run by David Davis right out of his home  so you know he s not out to rip you off  because  you obviously know where he lives  He has a limited selection  but he can find almost anything you want  Dave spent a few years as a manager at a dealership in Wellsville  NY  so he knows the business pretty well  If you re in the area  it might worth the trip  
 I ordered my ZX2 on Jan  22 before I read the opinions already written  I now have around 2 000 miles on it and I really like the car a lot I was ready to hate the car because it took 10 weeks from day of order to day of delivery  I was also prepared to be disappointed in the performance of the car because I read some of the negative comments on this page  Neither have been the case the car is a 4 speed with cruise control which works extremely well even on hills  I ve been driving small Fords since 1972 when I got a Pinto and have gone through the Pintos and the Escorts ever since  This car is as good or better than any of the others that we ve owned  It s fun to drive very comfortable for the two of us that own it and use it  It wouldn t be a good choice for a family only seats 4 but it does have a good sized trunk  My gas mileage is regularly in the 30 mph range  I do a lot of short trips and a few 100 mile trips and the mileage has been around 30 every time we ve filled it  I didn t get the cd in it  just the radio and cassette player so have no problem with a cd changer in the trunk  It does step right out when you want to go unlike some cars that take forever to reach the 65 speed limit on our expressways  The only problem I have at this time is that we can t find a good place to mount the  deer whistlers  that we put on all of our vehicles  I ended up paying a little under  14 000 for the car with cruise control  comfort group which included air conditioning  and the power package which gave me power windows  door locks and keyless entry  That was after a  1500  Ford rebate  I haven t even found any little things that require taking it back to the dealer like you usually do when you buy a new car  or used one for that matter  
 The Mazda Protege  I bought a  97 in  97 for several reasons  The company was having a national sale on the LX models for a DX price  When in buying any automobile  look for the national ads  In the test drive  the car handled really well  Reading Consumer Reports helped in my decision to buy the Protege also  Overall the car held up in the mechanics department  It had just enough of the sporty look to have people give it a second glance  but not too flashy  I felt the steering was bit too touchy  but I have gotten used to that over the last 2 5 years  The one thing I don t like about the Protege is when I need to make a  run for it  the car it self doesn t have much get up and go  unless you tack it over 3 RPM s  That may also be because I have a manual and not an automatic  I ve also had a lot of electrical problems  The worst one has been with the speakers  These are stock speakers and the dealership has replaced all of them  but I m still having the same problem  They cut in and out at times for no reason  And for some reason I ve gone through 3 dome lights  but that could just be the manufacturer of the bulbs  This car does have excellent gas mileage though  I average 25 city to 32 highway  The seating is very comfortable  especially the front seats  I believe this car is really designed more for the smaller person  not the tall or big  Overall driving of the Protege is roomy and comfy  Taking long trips isn t a problem in this car  I do not like where they have put the E Brake though  It s right in between of the seats  Behind that is small   hardly useful storage bin  They should have made that all a storage bin or left is alone and put the E brake behind the wheel  Average price for this model  LX  all power  CD player  is around  16 000  Who should buy this car  Small  not too tall of a person that needs a good family commuter car  Who shouldn t  Tall or big people that want need a car for show and tell  I really like the Protege and will probably end up buying another one in the next 5 8 years  Reliability on the Protege is very high br br  
  I ve revised this opinion slightly after this vehicle was totalled  courtesy of another driver who made a left turn directly in front of me in September 2000 I m glad I chose my 4WD JLX  Grand Vitara in May 1999 for a tad under  20k  all included  over competing vehicles like the Honda CR V  Toyota RAV 4  Subaru Forester and Nissan XTerra  It was a great  peppy little pug of an SUV that s perfect for singles  couples and small families   especially if you live or drive to where the weather is a challenge  where the low range and high range 4WD come in handy I loved the little extras that were included with the GV  like AC  rear defogger  cruise control  rear wiper washer  and even a little light inside the drawer that would be an ashtray if I smoked I didn t like the strangely missing things  like an armrest  I had one added  an idiot light to warn me that I m REALLY close to running out of gas  and the substandard sound system that comes with the vehicle  And the darn rear gate opened from left to right  which  in the USA  is the  quot wrong way quot  for loading or unloading things from or onto a curb that is the right of the vehicle Driving the GV was a pleasure  Its 155 HP engine delivers great low end torque and shifts smoothly  Up until 85 mph or so  it s very confidence inspiring  despite it s springy and rugged suspension suitable for REAL offroading with confidence  Mileage could be better  I got about 16 MPG overall  which  given the much smaller than Durango size of the GV  is not impressive   Indeed  as I revise this opinion after the accident  I must say that the relatively low mileage  combined with the hike in gas prices since I d bought this car  are factors in my choosing a more gas efficient vehicle next But I wouldn t change my SUV if I could choose differently  I had looked forward to driving mine for many years to come   when the aforementioned accident occurred  totalling my lil Suzuki This car just might have saved my life  Though it is hardly the Giant Cage Of Steel that you might get in a Suburban  its airbags and crumple zones kept me from far more serious injuries   I can t speak for it as to side impact collisions  as mine was head on with the other driver If it weren t for the relatively low MPG  and the higher price of gas these days  and the intangible psychological desire NOT to be looking out over the same hood I was looking out over when the accident happened  I WOULD have gotten this car again What did I get instead  A Honda Accord  Call me a lemming  but I WANTED bland after being in an accident   yet often I miss the peppy  and  apparently  rather safe in crashes  pug I used to drive br br  
 This is the hottest little car I have ever driven owned  It is extremely comfortable and doesn t  quot feel quot  like a small car  Like some other small cars  when you get in you feel like you are dropping down into the seat  you don t feel this way with the Cabrio  It feels like you are sitting up in a full size car  I love the fact that the roll bar is welded onto and is a part of the car  Not just a pretty feature  It is so easy to drive and handle  We love putting the convertible top down and just cruising  We put our poodle in the backseat and strap him into his harness via the seatbelt and take off  He loves it because he doesn t have to stick his head out of the window  He just has to breathe in all the smells     
 I bought my  94 GT for a whopping  3500  and have since then  been wholly satisfied  and pleasantly surprised  Among it s pros  there are 3 main ones that stick out when buying it and while owning it  1  Astonishing amounts of power are emitted from this 2 5 Liter V6  Loaded with dual overhead camshafts  that provide 24 valves for the six cylinders  it produces 164 horsepower  Since the car only weighs 2680  or something close to that  its acceleration is stunning  going from 0 60 in 7 4 seconds  It s no corvette  but for the price it can hardly be beat  plus modifications are easy to add  making it a very adaptable engine  Whether you re looking for performance or just around town driving  this car can really zip around and is fun to drive 2  Handling is one of the things I expected to be good when I bought this car  and it truly is  Since it has front wheel drive  a low center of gravity  and thick racing tires  it can take corners fairly quickly compared to many other cars in its category  specifically those with rear wheel drive  The probe always has a tight feeling when driving it  Its pretty tough to come off the road  slip  or lose control  3  And of course the final reason is simply an opinion  but the probe tends to catch eyes with its sleek body  It is both cool and tasteful  not over the top  but I don t really need to get into this pro since you can all see for yourselves what it looks like  Many feature moonroofs  premium sound systems  and retractable antennas 4  And oh yeah  it gets good gas mileage Of the cons  there are 2 main ones  One of them was obvious the second I test drove it  but the other took some time to get on my nerves 1  As many others have written  the interior  and mainly the rear seats  is pretty small  When there are no back seat passengers  the two front seats are fairly comfortable  providing ample leg room  and mediocre head room  In a standard  however  sometimes the passenger and the center console can get in the way of shifting  Without a passenger  shifting is comfortable  In my  94 probe there are two airbags  lending some assurance to the driver in such a small  quick car  Controls fall easily to hand  The seats themselves are adequate and comfortable  but nothing special  just clothe  And I must admit that the trunk cargo area is humongous  I m just not sure why some of that isn t part of the back seats  That much of the interior is fine The real problem with the interior is the lack of leg and head room in the back seat  This also makes is difficult for people to get in and out of the car since it is so low to the ground  and the two front seats must be moved forward to squeeze in the back seat passengers  If you are planning to be taking more than one person around frequently  do yourself a favor  save yourself some frustration  and don t buy this car  or any other low  two door car either 2  The other problem that became noticeable especially after owning it for a while  was the loud road noise  The faster you go the more you can hear the road  the tires  the wind  and rattles  It s one of the sacrifices you have to make when you buy such an inexpensive car  All of these noises  however  can be bettered with new balanced tires  Part of it  still  just can t be avoided  The fact that it is front wheel drive is a plus when you consider handling  but when it comes to road noise and comfort it is a villain Despite what a few other reviews wrote  I have had few problems with my probe  It has proved reliable and consistent  I ve had to replace the distributor  and that s the only thing I ve done in a year  Though many of the newer cars these days are boasting horsepower in the 200 300 range regularly  the probe still stands above many of its competitors  including the mitsubishi eclipse  the toyota celica  and the nissan 240sx  in performance  falling behind only the more expensive honda prelude and acura integra  in comfort and reliability  It is a sheep in wolf s clothing  providing incomparable bang for it s buck  It s a great first car for teens or college students  I would probably avoid it if I had a family  All in all  it is a car I enjoy immensely and get comments on frequently  I ll keep it as long as it runs  which from the looks of it could be a while as long as you keep up with basic maintenance  
 In March of 2003 I drove from Ontario Canada down the I 75 to Fort Lauderdale Florida to purchase my 2000 V 6 laser red Mustang Convertible  I am in no way a Mustang fanatic  in fact I know very little about Mustangs  I do know enough about mustangs that I love all of the retro touches on the new body style  When you put my 2000 beside an old 1965 you can easily see the inspiration for the design  I made the long drive to find a perfect and rust free used Mustang convertible and the car is worth every mile of my trip  My laser red Mustang is an auto with beige leather and power everything with a beige top  Every time I drive this car I find myself appreciating it a little more  The V 6 has plenty of power for any kind of legal driving and will still pull hard out of the corners  The 4 wheel disc brakes are smooth and powerful  The power top works great and is quick enough to put up at a red light  although it does leak a bit in a heavy rain  I guess that s just part of owning a convertible  I put this car away for the winter  so I can t comment on winter traction but in the summer the stock Goodyears do an excellent job The V 6 does lack the deep growl of the V 8 and the rear end looks much better with the dual exhaust  A new exhaust may be comming next season  The little 15  rims and tires bother me a bit on my V 6  There is too much room between the wheels and the fenders  it looks like a 4x4  Next up after the dual exhaust will be to find a good set of used 17  GT rims and have the suspension lowered  which is an inexpensive job  My wife and I have a 3 year old and the car seat fits nicely in the back  My daughter loves the convertible and begs to have the top down  I put her in after I put the top down  and I find it easier to lift her in than putting her into out 4 door truck  The back seat is really only suited for kids or a duffle bag Having said all that  there really is no other feeling like driving the classic American muscle car with the sun and the wind  I would never have considered this car as a hard top  If you re going to put up with all the inconveniences of a tiny sports car  it had better reward you with the top down experience  
 I bought a new Volkswagen Cabrio GLS last month for my 16th birthday from my dad s BMW  Porsche  Volkswagen dealership in Corpus Christi  Texas  At first I was looking into a Saturn coupe  then I concidered the Hyundai Tiburon  but I finally found the perfect car  I got it in Desert Wind  kinda a silver  tan ish color very cool  with black leather  It s the perfect car for our part of the country because the summers are HOT and the winters dont get warmer than 65  It s the perfect car to cut school and drive to the Mustang Island beach with my friends  dont tell my parents lol  First  the cons   not very many though  One of the biggest problems with EVERY Volkswagen at my dad s place is that the trunk release keyless entry almost NEVER works  But the  1 problem is the CUPHOLDERS  The front cupholders are only small enough to hold a small coffee or a soda can  but nothing bigger  Also you can t have tall cups there because the dashboard controls interfere with it  But  the single cupholder in the back is big  so I usually put my drinks back there and reach for it  inconvient but minor  Also  it s a little hard to get leg room and distance from steering wheel to work together  I m tall  6 2 quot  so that only amplifies the problem  If I adjust the seat so I comfortablly reach the pedals  I m too far brom the steering wheel  This makes the person in the seat behine me a little ucomfortable  Though the back seats are small  they re the biggest I ve seen on any convertable  except the BMW 323Ci but that s out of the price range of most teenagers starting at 32000  Finally  I wish the cruise controls were on the steering wheel  but theyre on the turn signal arm so it takes getting used to   one time i thought i set cruise control but i really made my blinker flash right  Now the PROS  First of all  even though it s only a 2 0 115HP engine  convertables in same price range usually have stronger engines  its VERY nimble  sporty  and easily manuevers through traffic  Another thing is the headlights  My girlfriend thinks they re so cute and I think they are too  The interior lights are beautiful too  at night they glow a soft blue and red against the black  very nice  The heated leather seats are great when it gets cold in winter  and to us south beach texans  65 is freezing  The CD changer is great and easy to use  Another great thing is the power top  its VERY fast to take off and on so you can do it when youre stopped at a red light  The one touch power windows are great  i just touch the window controls and all 4 go down on one touch  thus the name  I wish they had rear window controls in the front AND back though but they only put them in the front dash  The backseat can fold down so you can increase the cargo space  The trunk space itself is great  for a convertable  I mean it s no Cadilac trunk but its a big trunk for a convertable  But when its packed with luggage its hard to get to the CD changer  SO bottom line this is a GREAT car for anyone  from 1st time buyers to retired people  i wouldnt recommend it for a family though  but for everyone else Buy it   SJK br br  
 I first heard about this vehicle by word of mouth and I figured I might as well take a look at it  I went to my local Ford dealer and test drove it  I fell in love with it the moment I heard the V8 Triton engine rev up  When you drive this vehicle  it s like walking on water  it s so incredibly smooth  The roominess of this truck is so comfortable  it s almost unbelievable  Some major pros about this vehicle is that although it rides like a car  it has the benefits of a truck  like being higher  and feeling safer  I truly recommend this vehicle to anybody  This vehicle is perfect for large families who want to get rid of the stereotypical mini van family and want to explore the world in their new Expedition  The Ford Expedition is the best vehicle for your money  hands down br br  
 We bought our 1999 Windstar LX used towards the end of my pregnancy with our third child  This is our first minivan   wanted to make sure it was well rated and safe  so we did a lot of checking around  The first 8 months went by without incident  but since then we have had nothing but problems  Ironically  it all started immediately following recall service  The first problem was a wiring issue  It had died on me on my way home   we had to have it towed  They found that there were wires that had apparently been cut under the dashboard  This was not covered  being that  we found out then  our warranty had expired not by mileage  but years we were told by the salesman we had 1 year   almost 18 000 miles left  As I was driving home from picking it up from that service  I noticed the check engine light was on  Upon checking my manual when returning home  it said to drive the vehicle through 3  cycles  before taking it for service  I did that   found out a week later that we had an oxygen sensor that needed to be replaced  Also  not covered  I did at least get them to take the diagnostic charge off  being that whoever test drove it after the service should have seen the check engine light  Anyway  moving on  next there was the idle problem I could start the car   it would run as long as I had my foot on the gas pedal  Apparently a valve was getting stuck open   had to be replaced  Immediately after this problem was fixed  I traveled to Georgia to visit friends    upon trying to return home my transmission went out  At 30 000 miles  Luckily  the only thing that happened is that the overdrive light started flashing after being on the highway for a few minutes    I returned to my friend s house  I have read about incidents where the van accelerates on its own  or takes off into reverse  2 weeks after trying to go home and a lot of stress  I made it home with my infant   2 sons just in time for school to start  I got the dealer to cover half of the costs  they have  hidden warranties  they don t tell you about called p05 and p07  but it was still  1200  Needless to say I will not only never buy another Ford  but I would strongly agree with others stating how awful Ford customer service is  Do a search on the internet about Windstars   you will find as much information on transmission   steering rack problems as you do for the Caravans  They say the customer service is supposed to be improving  but I don t believe selling cars that they know have problems is good customer service  This has been a KNOWN problem for years  
 Venture offers a comfortable roomy ride  I took my Venture on a trip from NY to FLA  Very nice ride good air conditioning handles road well  Good fuel economy  Handles well in heavy rain  My model has rear Captain seats which make it difficult to get into rear seat unless you tilt seat forward by pulling release bar  Kids enjoy their own music system which allows them to listen to their music while the adults listen to theirs  Rear AC helps keep van cool even on very hot days  My van has been brought in for service about 10 times in 1 year for minor problems such as rattles  problem with automatic sliding door  leak in sealed beam headlight  Overall I am happy with the van br br  
 In October 1998  I purchased a 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier brand new  I ve had it about two years  and for the most part find it to be pretty reliable  and the fuel economy is very good  However  if you own one of these cars  and  especially if you are going to buy one used   there are a couple of things you need to know that could prevent some problems down the road I had had my car for about a month when I got the first recall notice  It stated that  certain  98 Chevrolet Cavaliers with the 2 2 liter engine may have a problem where the upper radiator hose contacts the battery tray  and could eventually cause a coolant leak if left unrepaired  I immediately took my car took the service department of the dealership I purchased it at  with the recall letter  They checked it out  and determined that it did indeed have the problem stated in the letter  A clip was installed on the radiator hose  and the problem was fixed  for free  of course Earlier this year  I received another letter  This one was not a recall campaign  but a technical service bulletin  The letter stated that  some  98 Chevrolet Cavaliers equipped with the 2 2 liter engine may experience rough idle and hesitation  which could be caused by loose and improperly seated spark plug wire terminals  The letter stated that if your car experienced any of the symptoms listed  to take it to your dealership service department  and if the problem was found to be the spark plug wire terminals  it would be fixed for free  However  if the problem was being caused by a source other than than the spark plug wire terminals  you would be billed for all repairs  unless they were covered under your warranty I would have to say that the 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier has been a good car for me  If I had it to do all over again  I probably would have bought one that had more options  mine is the base  but overall I have been satisfied 11 28 00 UPDATE Currently  the car has developed a chronic rough idle and stalling problem  which has been determined to be completely unrelated to the spark plug wire problem mentioned above  and despite being taken to the repair shop on three different occasions  no mechanic can pinpoint the problem  Also  you hear a loud  thunk  from the rear of the car every time you release the brakes  and if there is so much as a drop of moisture in the air  every time you try to apply the brakes they will grab so hard it makes the car jerk in a way that is like an inexperienced driver who is learning a stick shift for the first time  I sorely regret my decision to purchase this beast  and I am now looking into selling it  and hopefully purchasing a HONDA br br  
 AARGH  Three kids  a baby bag  football equipment  a dog and my husband s stinky shoes  yes  he likes to take his shoes off when he drives  was more than our little car  amp  my nose  could handle  To put it simply  we needed room  Our little computer business didn t help ease the strain on the car either  Computers piled all over the floor and back seat  it s no wonder the police officer looked at me as though I had just held Computer Warehouse up at gunpoint Room is what we got with the Dodge Caravan  aka Plymouth Voyager with a different front grill  Just a basic model   no frills   uh   other than the have to have tint in the rear for those football sundays where I d rather the 13 yo walk home then sit in my car in his uniform for the trip back to the house  Oh  and the AC  I have to have AC  I don t care if I live in Alaska  I HAVE to have AC The Caravan handles nice although it takes some getting used to backing up from a different height  The engine is quiet with the faint Dodge Plymouth trademark Jet engine whine when traveling at highway speeds of around 65 mph  Front seats were semi stiff for the first 2K miles but are perfect now The Caravan Voyager is the perfect car for young families with up to 5 children  just don t ask me to sit in back between two of them  It s versitile for business as the seats now are on rollers to make more room AND can fold down as well  This feature also comes in handy when the kids want to eat their icecream cones IN the new car   just push the seats up  lay down a sheet  and voila  Instant playhouse without the mess If I were Dodge  what would I change about this mini van  For one thing the spare tire  hey guys  WHAT is that  a CD  And it s still a PITA  you all can figure this abreviation out for yourselves   to get to  And in my 13yo 5 10 quot  son s opinion  do something about the leg room for adults in that far rear seat  Oh  the poor kid  glad I m the driver   Great car   still glad we bought it     
 All in all the van has proven to be dependable  Lots of little annoying things went wrong  The most serious was that the large sliding door quit opening  I have not had that fixed yet  Tape player quit working along with the remote radio panel  Bought the van in 96 and all these quit in 98  Power mirrors don t work now  AC fan went out last year  All these except for the large sliding door seem small  Front end hard to keep inline  but Arkansas roads seem to help that  Motor is still strong after 121 000 miles and mechanically I would not be scared to drive this van cross country  It would take alot to fix all the little things wrong to make this a real nice van again  Plan on trading soon No problem with motor or drivetrain  Put starter on last year br br  
 That is what I was told by a a Ford Motor Company engineer who I met with to discuss a vibration in the gas pedal at 2 250 RPM  since that time the vibration has gotten much worse  and at times the transmission hesitates shifting to the next highest gear  He also told me that his bosses 2000 Windstar had the same vibration  He stated to me that it was a  normal operating condition  to me it was not anything normal and I would not have purchased a 2000 Windstar if I would have noticed it during our test drive  The first time I noticed it was when we were driving 3 hours and I noticed it at highway speeds and my foot started falling to sleep  I questioned the engineer at the time if this was  normal  then why did Ford fix the problem in the 2001 models  He did not answer me  I did not have this vibration in my 1995 Windstar  why was it added in 2000 and removed in 2001  My concern is what does it mean  Could it be mismatched parts  incorrect tolerances  something wearing in the transmission    and will I have a problem after 36 000 miles are on the vehicle  Consumer Reports even suggests to stay away from several of the model year Windstars  including the 2000 model  additional note I talked to an ex engineer at Ford and he was not surprised what I was experiencing  because his parents complained about the same vibration in their 2000 Windstar  The questions to ask yourself is what did Ford change in newer models and why if in their words the issue in the 2000 model is a  normal operating condition  
 I originally was looking to purchase the Audi A4  but the price of the vehicle made me swing the other way  It is basically the same exact car with a differnt manufacturers name for less money  Go figure  I love the way the car handles and of course a German manufactured car speaks for itself on its reliability and they way which it was built  I have had the car for about 8 months now and had nothing but happiness I especially love the heated seats  they heat your back too  Who should buy this vehicle  Well if you are looking at an Audi I believe that you should seriously consider the Passat  Why pay more when you can get the basically the same car  Save the money and if you feel so inclined  send some of it to me  If you purchase a Passat it is almost guaranteed happiness  Happy driving br br  
 I thought the Toyota Corolla would be my dream car with it s compact shape  simple  but stylish interior and commercials that promised reliability  I thought I would fall in love with this car Boy was I wrong   quot Oh what a feeling quot  indeed  when only 30 days after purchasing a 1989 Corolla  deemed  quot a good little car quot  by my mechanic  also a choice approved by friends and family  it decided to die There was no warning that there was something wrong with the vehicle  or that the engine was about to quit running  I was greatly disappointed to be stuck with a car now in need of an engine To make matters worse  there was not an engine to be found for many months  Whether this was due to a sudden need for engine replacements  which would not surprise me  I did not know  All I knew was that I was stuck with a shoddy  useless vehicle So the Toyota Corolla proved to be unreliable  inefficient  inferior and low quality  Even my Hyundai outlived the Toyota It was also cramped and uncomfortable  e   
 Well  not exactly but it has gotten me this far  I own a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire and must write an epinion on it for everyone to see  First off let me tell you that I am only going to explain to you the interior and durability of this car  I am not going to go into great detail about the engine and stuff because I really no nothing about that stuff  that is my husbands area  I bought my car in 1998 and it had 5 miles on it and that was my damage for test driving it  I instantly loved it because it was small inexpensive and was brand new I bought the car and have had it ever since then  Well that was then and this is now  Two years later  I have two children two car seats two diaper bags one husband and much other needed equipment that must go with us where ever we go  This car is way too small to be a family car  The durability isn t so great either  My back seat is caving in from the pressure of both of the children s car seats and I can t seem to fix it  It looks as though it was just thrown in there and looks very generic  The drivers side seat belt broke and I can hear it rattling in my ear the whole time I am driving  My brakes I have replaced them twice since I have had the car  My husband say s it is because they are anti lock brakes but I don t see me having to replace brakes every year  He tries to take up for the car but I owe  9 000 00 on it and it is just not right  The odd thing about it all is I always take very good care of my car  My husband keeps the oil changed rotates the tires  and the whole nine yards  I keep the interior clean and wash the car once every other week  My conclusion is that this is not a very good family car and I better start looking for a heavy duty car quick before my children get older and the whole thing falls apart on me i I think to myself why didn t I get that extended warranty i br br  
 I discovered my 1996 Ford Escort quite by accident  After searching in vain for 5 weeks to replace my beloved Geo Metro  a kindly old used car salesman  believe it or not  a few still exist  recommended the Escort to me  I made a quick dash for my trusty Consumer Reports used car guide and found that  to my surprise  the Escort holds up beautifully over the years  The price was reasonable and it had just what I was looking for  a fuel efficient 4 cylinder engine  A C  a good heater plus a few little perks along the way I ultimately wanted a standard transmission but settled for the automatic due to the good deal I was offered  This is the car I wish I had had while going to college On the outside  let s face it  the 96 Escort is well ugly  But I didn t buy it to impress the ladies I bought it to get my butt from point A to point B without a lot of maintenance The Escort is solid  reliable transportation  You don t have to go far to find a dealer for parts and most any repair shop can work on it  though I ve never had to take it in for any repairs since I bought it last February  The stock AM FM Cassette stereo sounds surprisingly good  negating the need to replace it any time soon  It handles just fine and due to its 1 9L engine  most come with a 1 8  it goes up hills without any extra effort  It drives well in the snow and the heater is warm enough cook muffins with  Good gas mileage too The only two downsides to the car are the James Bond villain auto glide seat belts  scary  and the somewhat stiff front seats  Other than that  if you get a fair book price you will be glad you purchased this homely little performer br br  
 For better or worse  when one slides up into the seat of the Isuzu Trooper Limited 4x4  subconscious thoughts of ice cream trucks and school buses surface in your mind  You sit stone upright in the high  firm seat  leaving your legs a straight down stretch to reach the pedals  The thin  narrow fold down armrests on the inboard side of the front driver and passenger chairs hark back to the old  van  days in the seventies  They seem too narrow to provide good support without your elbow slipping off  You peer out over the flat hood of the Trooper looking downward on the road  Then you reach down  slide the gear selector into  D  and off you go  ding ding  There is an open  airy feeling in the cabin due to the large sections of glass surrounding you and the low center strip console  The optional jumbo power moonroof opens up to a wide blue sky over both front and rear seats  This is great on cool autumn days  The Trooper tries to be unoffensive  seemingly tuned to be as smooth riding as possible on it s 4WD underpinnings  This makes for unexpectedly smooth boulevard cruising  although road irregularities do make themselves known  This is a truck after all  Due to the plush ride tuning  you feel slightly disconnected and buffered from road feedback  There is negligible  dead  steering on center  and high pitch roll in the curves  This is expected given the tall  narrow  top heavy characteristics of this vehicle  The upside of this is that you are driving a vehicle with excellent capacity for people and gear  The Trooper s low load floor  swing out rear doors  rear step  and boxy compartment shape makes for easy loading and packing  There is more room in the cargo area behind the rear seat in the Trooper than in just about any other midsize SUV  This in itself merits purchasing this vehicle for many who don t want the dinosaurs  Expedition  Suburban etc  and whose families have outgrown the compacts  The DOWNSIDE of the setup is that the 3 2 liter V6 is unduly burdened by the weight and mass of this beast  Acceleration is barely adequate  and you can t help but feel sorry for the little motor that has to pull this brute as it whines and painfully pulls through the gears  You tend to want to feather toe the gas whenever possible so as not to bruise the poor widdle weak powerplant and eek out just a little more mileage from your fossil fuels  Dropping your foot on the throttle is an unpleasant experience  as the motor booms buzzes and thrashes defiantly as it goes about its daunting task  Considering that this vehicle has such a high profile and is aerodynamically the equivalent of a flying brick  one has to wonder whether the paltry 13 mpg highway average achieved is worth foregoing the larger  V8 powered midsizers such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee which boasts 17 mpg and a 7 5 second 0 60  The Limited model as tested comes with such amenities as power heated leather seating with an ingenious  keep warm  feature  selectable transmission settings  winter mode for 2nd gear start in slippery road conditions and a power setting which raises shift points for somewhat better performance  heated power folding outside mirrors  Isuzu premium am fm cassette sound with 12 disc CD changer  power  skyroof  fog lights  alloy wheels  chrome trim everywhere  snazzy two tone accent paint and alloy wheels  The climate control system is manual  and struggles to cool the vast expanse of cabin area here is where dual a c would be very welcome  Expect passengers in the rear seat to break out in a sweat until the air circulates enough to cool down the cabin a long wait  The icing is a nice roof rack and molded stone mudguards  Creature feature wise  this vehicle comes with just about everything imaginable at its time of manufacture in 1995 and most features seen regularly in luxury vehicles today  The deciding factor for many is in the Trooper s sterling reputation for reliability and durability  Not having to bring your SUV into the shop once a month for repairs is peace of mind enough to convince naysayers to buy into this handsome vehicle  It has been said that nothing short of a nuclear blast or armageddon could keep a Trooper from reaching its destination  Although the majority of Trooper Limited owners will never take their vehicles off road  the knowledge that they have the ability to pilot the truck just about anywhere taking advantage of the manual transfer 4WD is an ego and confidence booster  You know  not that you would  but you could  In summary and in this reviewer s humble opinion  the 1996 Trooper Limited is a vehicle worthy of considering if you are shopping for a rock solid few years old  low cost alternative to more pricey Japanese competitors such as the Toyota 4 Runner  Favorable resale values make the Trooper very attainable currently  although one might be better served to aim just a bit higher after all  more modern iterations of the now extinct Trooper feature a much needed power boost from a beefed up 3 5 version of this venerable powerplant  plus an impressively effective and easy to use electronic shift on the fly 4WD transfer called  TORQUE ON DEMAND  which can automatically shift power in slippery situations  Check out other reviewers  opinions on the 1999 Trooper and judge for yourself  Otherwise  if you just don t like the svelte swept back nose style of the newer Trooper  or you think the slower more rudimentary model carries more hardcore appeal or charisma  you really can t go wrong by sticking with this excellent hi value choice  Happy motoring  
 We bought a 91 Taurus almost 2 years ago  It seemed to be in fairly good shape and drove well for a short time  The first sign of problems to come was the CV joints  After they were replaced  the brakes squealed BADLY even after the pads and shoes were replaced  Then the famous CHECK ENGINE light intermittently throughout the drive  But  saving the best for last  the notorious TRANSMISSION BUG has to be the best icon for the 91 Taurus they should condsider changing their logo  No downshifting on highway exits  no upshifting when entering a busy street spontaneous shifting up AND down while going down the street  Or MY personal favourite  the NO shifting  No up  down  sideways just no gear at all just a loud screaming transmission then a sudden neck cracking lurch into 2nd gear and on a related note  I have NO speedometer now thanks to the transmission  Currently relying on a radar detector to avoid tickets  lol But to be fair  I will say that  when I am not getting whip lash from the jerky transmission  which I can find NO mech to work on for less than twice what I paid for the car due to the  quot upgrades quot  ford made to the 91 model s transmissions  or wetting myself from the ever worsening loose steering  it IS a comfortable ride with lots of room front and back but in my opinion  a 10 speed bicycle would be a better deal br br  
 1999 was the last year for the 3000GT  After 9 years with the same basic design  prices had slowly crept up and sales began to lag  Thus  Mitsubishi went out with one final hurrah  The 1999 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR 4  With extremely aggressive styling not seen in any previous models  this final edition served as a reminder of all that was right with the original 3000GT First of all  the active aero system returned  Dual fins front spoilers in the nose are functional  adjusting automatically to create more downforce on the front tires during high speeds  The rear spoiler is a very large  wing  taken from the design of the Mitsubishis racing in the European rally championships  The car came in four colors  black  white  red  and green  I have never heard of a green one  so I suppose no one may have ordered it  Being an anniversary edition  there were also 8 factory paint options  One of which  holographic pinstriping  is on my 3000GT  It is very subtle and embedded in the paint along the curve of the body panels  The engine is a 3 0 liter V6  mounted so that each bank of 3 cylinders has its own turbocharger and intercooler  The turbos produce a stock 14 psi boost  The engine is mated to a 6 speed Getrag transmission  replacing the old 2 bolt 5 speed which had so many problems  The engine is rated at 320hp at 6500 rpm  and 315 ft lb at 2600 rpm  Having driven this vehicle to its full performance capabilities  I think it is completely possible that these numbers are under rated  This is one serious perfomance car  It is officially  race ready  and even says so in the manual  There is a reinforced stainless steel roll cage  3 point safety harnesses  and a racing seat for the driver  Performance figures for the  1997  VR 4 were 4 8 seconds 0 60  and 13 6 seconds in the quarter mile  I have never seen perfomance figures for a 1999 model  Top speed is electronically limited to 160 mph  The 1999 VR 4 remained all wheel drive  with  4  245 40 18 tires on beautiful chrome 18  rims  It also has all wheel steering  with the back tires turning up to 1 5 degrees above 37 mph  The 1997  again  tested at  95g on the skidpad  beaten only by the Ferraris  Porsche 911 Turbo  and the Viper  The brakes are vented  and huge  with active scoops in the body panels near the rear wheels to force air across them during high speed braking  With all of these mechanical performance features  the only negative is the weight   approximately 3600 lbs  Comfort features in this car are also plentiful Standard is a 210 watt  6 speaker  Infinity stereo system  It has a tape and a CD player   a 10 disc CD player was an option that I did not get  The car has leather seats  power everything  dual antennas  automatic climate control  integrated remotes for your garage doors  dual AC adapters  and a sunroof  Safety features include the before mentioned roll cage  front and rear crumple zones  dual airbags  side door guard beams  and ABS Finally  the sound  Each of the dual exhausts  each with a dual chrome exhaust tip  has a different sized muffler  This is to give the exhaust a two tone sound tuned specifically by Mitsubishi  Revving the engine  this 3000GT sounds like a Formula 1 car  I have seen several sets of production numbers for this car  The lowest number I have seen was 45  and the highest was 192  This would represent total  99 VR 4s shipped to the U S  in 1999  That makes it one of the rarest sports cars in existence  To this day  I am happy I bought this car  It was quite expensive  but always brings a smile to my face  The only  problems  that I have encountered so far are people staring  and a lot of people who want to race  Overall  I purchased this vehicle for its looks  performance abilities  and safety features  I have not been disappointed and I would highly reccomend it to any collector or sports car enthusiast  
 I bought this car used out of necessity  What I like about the Suzuki is the reliability  It s easy to handle including bad weather  i e  snow  ice  I buy a huge bag of cat litter to weigh down the back to get good traction  The biggest complaint I have is last year at 68 000 miles I had to have my transmission replaced  There isn t much pick up so exiting out into heavy traffic is a bit tricky Like I said previously it s easy to handle  No problem with tight parking spaces and once out on the highway the drive is nice  The car does not keep out traffic noises and the front seats are ok but the back is cramped br br  
 I own a 93 Mercury Cougar  Although it is a bit larger than the other cars I own  it still feels nimble around town  The seats are extremely comfortable to sit in  People have fallen asleep in than many times before  There s plenty of room up front  but don t expect an adult to sit in the back for long The v8 isn t as powerfull as some that I have seen  but the power is there when you need it  Step on the gas and you can definatly feel the power of a big American V8  Build quality is as most of Ford products  Average There are some problems with it however  Such as the a c  I ve replaced the control panel 4 times  and it keeps breaking  I ve almost given up on it br br  
 I bought this car in 2001 when it was a highly hyped new model  I was impressed with the power and flexibility  The third row seats were the best available at the time without going to the very large suvs  The handling is excellent  particularly in wet weather  There are a few plastic parts that seem a little bit cheap  but this is true of all the competitors as well  Now  on to the point of the review After 2  years we have put nearly 50k miles on this vehicle  including 2 road trips of about 4k miles each  This includes a fair mix of western desert and national park dirt road driving along with a lot of freeway  Most of the remainder is city driving and weekend day trips  It has no more squeaks and rattles now than when we bought it  The sure handling has not broken down and there have been no major problems  The sound system is still working fine as is the navigation system  So it seems that this model could be a good choice if one is looking for a used suv  One gripe is that the windshield glass seems to be susceptible to chipping and cracking  I have read that the newer models have been improved to use thicker glass so this might not be an issue on newer models  The aftermarket glass seems to be as good as the original Honda glass  so that shouldn t be a worry if you see that  
 Wow  If you can pick up a 1990 Lincoln Continental that has been very well maintained  you will have a luxury car at a bargain price  The going price for these cars is  900 to  4000 depending on the condition  In 2002  this car is 11 to 12 years old  Be careful that the previous owners took good care of it  The car that I bought is in perfect running condition and will require some paint  The previous owners have made the repairs of the alternator  head gaskets twice  brake air suspension on four wheels  very expensive  and air conditioning reconditioned  The condition of the car at 120 000 miles is  Runs smooth as if it were new  starts perfectly  body excellent but needs a new paint job because of the sun  the interior trim needs some replacing at the handles  easy to steer  brakes well  radio speakers not too good  but I can fix that  one door window doesn t work  the seats are so comfortable that you feel like going to a parking lot and just sitting there  I love driving around town in this car  The moonroof works perfectly The size is COMPACT for a Lincoln Continental  So you are really buying a Ford Taurus sized car  It has very roomy back seats  It is a little big for me when parking or backing up  People are in definite envy when they see me driving a Lincoln Continental  They don t realize  I only paid  2500 00 for it  I am thrilled with this car  
 Despite the criticism the Contour has received  I ve found the car to be fast  comfortable  and a joy to drive  It seems that they got just about everything right in the  98 model year  and it missed the major decontenting that occurred in the  99 and 2000 models  For just over  9 000 in early 2001  my  1998 5  I still think my 20K mile  1998 5  Ford Contour SE V6 was a great buy  The SE trim level also features traction control  ABS  and other features that are great in the winter  and aren t found on every car at this price level  I ve found it handles great around curves or daily driving  while acceleration is quick and responsive  I m sure the V6 helps in this regard  I ve never driven the Zetec 4 cyl  but I understand some feel it s a bit sluggish in a car of medium size like the Contour  Whatever the case  the 170 horses put out by the 2 5L Duratech are plenty  and highway cruising  lane changes  and quick acceleration prove no problem At higher speeds  the engine is a bit loud  although many like it that way  so it s just something to consider  I tend not to notice as my upgraded speakers and subwoofer prove to be a nice way to drown out the engine noise  Speaking of that  though  consider yourself warned if you plan on adding speakers or other upgrades  the contour isn t the easiest car to mess around with  Each of the 4 stock speakers are in the doors  none in the rear deck like most cars  which means taking the entire door apart to replace them  Routing wires and such is a bit of a pain as well  as Ford has chosen looks  i e  concealing screws and wires in very difficult to reach locations  over upgradability  For most people who don t bother tinkering with their car  or who relegate that task to the specialists  it shouldn t even be an issue Unfortunately  I can t give any hard info on reliability or long term performance  as I have only owned the car just less than three months  But in that time I have drove it regularly and its always performed as good or better than I expected  Gas mileage is good  but not great  however this is my first car so I have no basis of comparison  However  I d say its probably about the same as most other cars with a similar sized engine  in the 20 25 mpg range  the 30 mpg highway rating from Ford is probably a bit too optimistic The interior is quite comfortable  and the 8 way adjustable power driver s seat is a nice touch  a memory function would have been nice  though  The interior lighting is a little dim  the car would have benefitted from a centrally located  dome light  which I understand is on the Mystiques and may have been on older model Contours  Rear seats  as most have said  aren t the most spacious in the world  but I don t see them as much of a problem at all  Adults will definitely fit  although it may not be comfortable for very long drives  not really any different from just about any mid size car  though So  what are the real flaws  I haven t found any yet  besides the fact that Ford  and especially the Contour  doesn t have such a great reliability reputation  I haven t had any problems so far  however  and hope it ll stay that way  It s probably worth it  though  knowing that I saved a few thousand dollars over a same year import car  you know  those  reliable  Hondas and Toyotas  Watch out for that depreciation  though  while it means I was able to get a great deal on the car to start with  it also means I can t expect much a few years down the line when it comes time to sell it  It s a trade off I m willing to take  though So yes  the car has its flaws  As you can see  though  most of them are relatively minor  and overshadowed by the car s great performance and price  After reading up on probably dozens of other contenders  I ve come to the conclusion that just about ever car in this price range will have a host of minor flaws and negative points  The 1998 Ford Contour  of all the cars I have looked at  puts forth the best combination of looks  performance  and features with a minimal of problems for under  10 000  
 Of all the cars I ve owned  the Mustang is by far the best value and definitely the best bang for the buck  I bought my  98 GT brand new back in May  1998  It has almost every option except for ABS brakes  which I now wish I had gotten Here are my impressions of Mustang ownership compared to other cars I have owned  2 Pontiac Trans Ams  2 Mustangs  1 Acura Integra  2 Porsches  3 BMWs  1 VW Quality  The build quality of the car is vastly improved over the previous generation Mustangs  The handling  braking  steering feel and overall feel of the car is also far above the previous generation  Compared to the foreign cars I ve owned  however  the Mustang falls short  There are a couple of small buzzes and creaks that I hear on my daily drive that are irritating  Considering the performance and level of equipment I got for the money  I guess I can t really complain about the level of workmanship Comfort  I am 6 2  and really wish that the front seats would have more travel  I know this was fixed on the  99 and up cars  but unfortunately I cannot get accustomed to the new chiseled look of the newer Mustangs  Down the road I will find a fix for the seat travel problem  The other problem I have is with the seats themselves  Although the seats are very comfortable  they are not the ideal seats for a  sports car  These are the kind of seats I would expect to find in an entry level car  not Ford s pony car  Overall I find them mediocre at best Additionally  the headrests leave a lot to be desired  My fianc  had a  96 Mustang GT with better headrests than my 98  The 96 had headrests that could be adjusted for height and tilt   and were bigger than the current ones  Although far from perfect  they were much better than the garbage in my  98  The current headrests look as if they have been taken out of a mid 70s Ford LTD  For a tall driver  they are useless in case of a rear end collision  I plan on taking out those seats soon and installing a pair of aftermarket Recaros or Flofits to correct this matter  Aside from those two gripes  the car is quite comfortable  I have taken it on a few extended trips and it has fared quite well Performance  The car accelerates quite well and allows you to cruise with traffic effortlessly  My fuel consumption average has ranged from a low of 18mpg combined hwy city driving to a high of 25mpg on extended trips  For the kind of visceral thrills the car provides  it s a bargain to own  It runs equally good with 87 octane gas as any car I ve owned  No complaints whatsoever  If you are looking for the brutal acceleration of the Camaro Z28 or Firebird Formula Trans Am  the  94 through  98 GTs will disappoint though  Handling is on the safe side  understeering quite a bit Reliability  My car is about to hit 40 000 miles and I have only had one non scheduled visit to the dealer  The driver s window fell out of alignment and wasn t closing properly  The dealer fixed it in one day and the service was excellent  which is a far cry from the service I was used to in the 80s from Ford dealers  Aside from the window problem  my GT has surpassed every car I have owned in terms of reliability  even my Acura Integra  I have been running synthetic oil  either Mobil 1 or Amsoil  since about 10 000 miles and highly recommend it Overall  If you are buying a Mustang GT expecting to have the performance of a Corvette  the handling of a Ferrari  the brakes of a Porsche  and the overall refinement of a BMW  you will be highly disappointed  If you are looking for an affordable modern muscle car  then you ve come to the right place  If you are ready to live with the noisy exhaust  cramped quarters  higher than average visibility to highway patrol troopers  higher insurance and overall lack of refinement from this muscle car  you cannot go wrong  If I drive my Volvo for a week straight without touching the Mustang  I begin to wonder why I bought the car in the first place  However  after the first couple of miles behind the wheel of the GT I am reminded why  It is fast  reliable  relatively economical and a whole lot of fun to drive  Then I look at how much I have spent on repairs in almost 40 000 miles and an even bigger smile comes to my face Update  My Mustang served me well up to 47K miles  when I took it to the Lincoln dealer and traded it in  Regretfully  I say that because I miss the car  they gave me a very good trade in allowance and a new 2001 Lincoln LS is now occupying the spot formerly taken by the Mustang  
 We have had 2 Ford Windstars in the past 4 years  But we didn t trade in because of any problems  We traded it in to get a newer model and we are not sorry  We love our Windstar  The ride is superb and quiet  It is so comfortable to travel in  We ve been to Niagara Falls  Canada  Toronto and Montreal also  And we ve also done closer trips to Vermont  New Hampshire  Rhode Island  We are from Massachusetts  I have never had any problems to speak of with these vans and love the dependability of them  There s plenty of room for a family and cargo too  The seats are very comfortable  I happen to like Fords anyway  Haven t had any complaints in the 29 years we ve had them in our family  So I have good reason to stay with them  Our van also has the automatic sliding door in the right rear  We especially love that convenience  When you re bogged down with tons of shopping bags from a shopping day at the mall you really appreciate this feature  
 I have always been skeptical towards Ford vehicles after going through some lemons  In 1998 I purchased a brand new Escort LE  I was quite surprised by the price and wasn t sure what kind of quality to expect out of a  14 000 car and figured if I didn t like it that it wouldn t be hard to get rid of  First thing when I bought it I got a bumper to bumper warranty and am quite shocked I haven t had to use it for anything after 2 years I quite enjoy driving my car it picks up speed great  gets fantastic gas mileage thank goodness with the gas prices the last few months  handles great in all weather  turns beautifully  and there virtually isn t a sound to it Another thing that I love about this car is the massive amount of trunk space  I mean typically when you think of an Escort you visualize about 3 inches of space in the back and in all reality that is not the case  I managed to pack in 2 good size suit cases  2 sleeping bags  a tent  and 3 duffle bag without having to sit on the trunk to close it I absolutely have nothing negative to say so far about it 2 years and 70 000 miles later it s still going strong  I would recommend this car to anyone truly worth it br br  
 I have had my car now for about four months  and I Must say I am pretty happy  and at the same time uncertain  Now that I Have the car broken into with 14000 miles on it  I must say  it runs great  The handling on the car is great Controls on the car are easy to use  the safety Features on it make me feel safe in this LA traffic I love the extra large trunk  not to mention the awesome stereo system it has it I find this car very convenient to purchase  for about 15 000 you can get a fully loaded car  minus a sunroof  that is stylish  comfortable  and safe Now buying the car wasn t fun  When I bought my FOCUSES SE  the dealer must have thought that I was really dumb After seeing the car I wanted and after doing all the paper work  when I m getting ready to drive off the lot I notice scratches on the roof and dents in the hood from what I understand I m not the only person that received a damage car  Then trying to get the dealer to repair it was just ridiculous Second  it being a FORD  I have had the fallowing problems  So far my brakes have been squeaking since day one  and the dealer have just about given me every excuse in the book  I finally called ford  I take my car in next week  I ll see what happens Third  I really think my car has some king of electrical problem  Sometimes my trunk wont open  or the speed control will not set  or my trunk won t open when I push the button  I have tried to take it in to my local dealer  and all they tell me is that there familer with this problem  And since it only happens once in a while  I can never prove it to them Over all I am very satisfied with my car  I need to get these things worked out  but overall it really is a good car One recommendation I have if you looking for a ford Focus be sure to check the web for pricing  and bring that information to the dealer with you  As I have learned they have tried to mix combos of the LX  SE  ZTS  This only benefits them     
 I bought a  99 Ford ranger supercab XLT  4X4  I specifically wanted a small pickup truck with 4 wheel drive  I checked around for quite awhile  reading information on the internet  magazines etc  as to which model was best in it s class  The Ranger seemed to top them all and after test driving several of the competition I had to agree  I ve owned this vehicle for slightly over a year now and it rides the same today as it did when I bought it  Very tight  no rattles  and somewhat smooth for a small pickup  There is a slight wind noise through the side windows but I either got used to it or its minimal  I have the 6 cylinder engine in this one which has decent power  but you still need to kick it down when passing The seats are very comfortable in front but like all small pickups the back  quot side quot  seats face each other and are made for children at best  I could fit five in here for a short ride but 3 of them better be children  If there are children in the back be careful starting and stopping abruptly because they may smack their heads on the back window  ask my kids they ll tell you  The supercab does make for a nice area to store items  when you don t want them in the bed of the truck  I use it more for that reason than any other Gas mileage is slightly lower than the competition  probably in the 14 to 18 mpg range The truck is very sound and has not been back to the dealer for any type of warranty work  The stock am fm stereo cd player sounds great The four wheel drive option is fantastic and uses the standard Ford switch on the dashboard  Very simple Some recommendations if you re in the market for a small pickup First of all Buy a Ranger Get the supercab  but buy the model which allows the rear doors to open  This is a nice feature that I wish I had  It makes it much easier to get in and out and also to place bulky items back there If you can afford the costs get some of the option packages like remote mirrors etc if you re used to having these in your other vehicles you ll definitely miss them  I know I do br br  
 I purchased a 1998 Mazda 626 LX with the luxury package  I paid  23 000 for the car  It currently has 36 000 miles on it and I have been looking into buying another car  I have checked into the retail value of the car and it has been cut in half from the amount I paid for the car three years ago  That is very depressing  At this point  I am under on the car and if I decide to get rid of it I have to sell it out right and come out with nothing  When I purchased the car I was told how good the resale value was  I contemplated on buying a Honda Accord or the Mazda 626  A close friend owned a Honda Civic that costs  7 000 less than my car and received a better trade in value than I did  It really makes me upset to know that now I have to either get out of the car now  keep in for 3 more years  or come out in the end with nothing  I really love the car  but did not realize how much the value of the car decreased  The car is great to drive and very comfortable  but there are many reasons why Mazda may not be the best to buy br Sincerely br Monica  Texas City  Texas    
 I purchased my ZX2 in July of 1999  It is equipped with the HOT package  and to be honest with you  it was love at first sight  Not only do I love the looks of the car  but since it has the 15  wheels courtesy of the hot package  the car handles wonderfully  It gets great gas mileage too  and that was very important to me since I spend a lot of time commuting  I highly recommend this car to first time buyers  it is fairly inexpensive  and I was able to keep my payments in a decent price range  It is a very fun car  great for students and singles br br  
 When my wife finally succumbed to her SUV bug  we went to check out several models  The first one we looked at was the brand new tribute  It looked nice  and was comfortable to sit in  The problem came when we drove it  I sat in the back seat while my wife drove  I felt every bump we hit  I asked the salesperson if the chassis was based off a car or truck  I had heard it was based off the 626 chassis  He said it was made especially for the tribute  We own a 94 626 and I love it  it drives much more smoothly than the tribute  I would not be able to drive this vehicle on extended trips  Other SUV s we drove felt and drove much better  The vehicle was comfortable when sitting still  The stereo sounded good  Braking and acceleration were also good  This may very well be a good vehicle  in a few years when they get all the kinks out  The first year of a new design always has a few flaws that are worked out during production of the next years model  Another real life problem is the fact that it is a new model  Mazda has no sales incentives  No rebates  No special interest rates  Many people don t realize how much lower thier payment is due to these incentives  Mazda could not get the vehicle down into the payment range we expected for this priced vehicle We ended up buying a Honda CRV  It was a superior vehicle  a proven design  and cost much less br br  
 So Car   Driver started raving around mid 1994  anticipating the  new M3  would be a remarkable mix of high performance  practicality  and reasonable price  I wasn t even in the market for a car  but it just sounded great  In the fall I found a dealer with a demo car  an hour and a half away  and was just smitten  In love  but not wanting to get gouged  I bought a spot 9 months out on the waiting list  for a late model year 1995  at  3K under list When it finally arrived  it was athletic and beautiful  I went 1000 miles the first week  and ended up quietly raving to the extent that several friends bought one the next year Since then I ve put about 55K miles on it  no serious commute  but can honestly say I consciously enjoy the car nearly every time I m in it  It just moves exactly like you d like it to  Every non exotic car I drive seems imprecise by comparison  including many that are supposed to be great Here is the complete list of my negative observations  it s low  and takes a little attention to not scrub the front or middle on abrupt driveway transitions  the 1995 model  alone  doesn t have traction control  so I ve popped the back end out in the rain  or a flooded roadway  by unconsciously being deeper into the accelerator than I realized  By the way  in the course of some crazy fast runs on isolated backroads  I ve never experienced the snap oversteer some have reported here  rear tires have never lasted more than about 15K miles  the stereo is no better than OK After 6 years  I still love it  and someday I ll get the newer  more spacious  faster model  My one warning  because of it s enthusiasm and precision  you may end up driving around thinking that people are especially slow and inattentive in their lesser cars  Your M3 will be great fun  but will not inspire calm and tranquility  
 I have to state first that I did not purchase this vehicle  but it was very high on the list of vehicles that I was considering  It wasn t that there was anything wrong with the Xterra  it just didn t fulfill as many of our wants and needs as another did  the Ford Explorer  I was quite impressed by the Xterra   certainly a lot more impressed than I thought I would be  The stadium seating in the rear was quite a novelty and made for some amazing leg room and front view  The car salesperson who went with us was more than 6 feet tall  and he looked remarkably comfortable and stretched out in the back  The vehicle drives quite well  although there was an interesting vibration in the lower back of the driver s seat which I felt would alternate between somewhat of a relaxing massage for a short drive and possibly an annoyance on long road trips  The vehicle s seats weren t as cushy as compared to  say  a Ford Explorer  but for all basic SUV intents and purposes  it fares reasonably well The Xterra is utilitarian  There is no other word in my mind which fits it better  If you happen to be someone who is looking for a rugged  no frills SUV  this would be it  Its price range is very reasonable  However  we were approaching our vehicle search as parents of a small child  and we were looking for some cargo space without sacrificing too much comfort  and as was mentioned  another vehicle fit our needs better so we dropped the Xterra from our list I didn t like the very limited choices offered on the option packages   some of the options I wanted came specifically with other things I didn t want at all  and there seemed to be no way around it  Bear in mind though  that the individuals intending the Xterra for more rugged use would probably find everything perfectly tailored to their needs br br  
 My girlfriend first told me she wanted a truck I downed the idea  because I am a car man  I never liked trucks  no room  So she brought it home and to my surprise it looked good  She got the Sports package with a sunroof and back leather cove  I liked the ride  not bouncy or stiff  just like a car  So then I got to drive it once  and the first thing I noticed was the fact of being up high  I though   this is going to hard to move around in real traffic   but I was wrong  It handled just like a car  Turns nice  but parking was what I expected  The steering wheel just grinds when you can t turn anymore  But overall it was great  The super cab has room for one adult or two small kids  They have seat belts for each side  Now if you want to go on a trip  you might want to load luggage in the truck bed  The 4 wheel drive works nice  it got us through the winter just fine  Our drive was our worst nightmare  but not this year  The only big flaw was fish tailing on ice and slippery roads  Drive slow or get sand bags  a lot of sandbags
